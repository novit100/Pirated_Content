21,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Life aren&#39;t everything, believe me i&#39;m dead.",1
22,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This Ted talk isnt about how shes saying looks dont matter shes saying how looks do matter and we need to change the social norms when it comes to how we view Beauty wether its with racial tensions and profiling and how young people especially girls are hating themselves more and more I swear this comment section read the Title without understanding anything at all,1
23,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,if she won the lottery then I bought 999 of 1000 tickets and still lost.,1
24,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you! Everything that happens can be seen as a lesson. We should try to look at both sides of all stories before we judge...,1
25,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,just imagine how easy it&#39;s for her to just say looks doesn&#39;t matter.,1
26,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If she thinks that looks are not everything, why would she be that insecure",1
27,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Simple, to the point, not too long and polite way of describing that appearance is not the most important thing. This may sound harsh but Ive always said, Good looking ones for a night, smart ones for life. Hopefully this quote will make young people to decide whether they want to take the route of insecurity or the route of security and resilience. Think about it!",1
28,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The salty unit comprehensively suggest because alloy systematically drain astride a tacit half-brother. educated, daffy slice",1
29,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Gynocentrism,1
30,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"All of those saying that looks are everything are basically saying that only a small percentage of people in the world have good lives. Its bullshit. Sure, good looks get a lot of people farther in life and make things easier, but the idea that theyre everything implies that only hot people do well in life. Only sad people who let their looks hold them back would agree to that.",1
31,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks get you through the door. Personality keeps you in.,1
32,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Can she even relate!?,1
33,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"after watching this video, it makes me believe that  image is different from look, but  looking good can build up an good image easily",1
34,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,like 90% of these comments are from people who didn&#39;t even bother to watch the talk...or just didn&#39;t get it.,1
35,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Said by the beautiful model... Hypocrisy is in her tone. I am being respectful and such even joke in the right moment and I got decent paying job, I can&#39;t get a partner.... <br><br>Looks are everything in this world.<br><br>She admit that she has privileged good for her but does it changed the fact I can&#39;t relate to her. <br><br>Hey Ted Talk make the one who speak has in ugly face than us. Oh wait.. you just pick the good looking ones too",1
36,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What is is trying to say is that the person you see in a billboard is not her individual self its a creation which was created by many individuals. That is why she changed her clothing, what she also mentions is that modeling to control of her life as her niche was lingerie modeling and as a model she is insecure about the way she looks and she has to eat a certain way and train a certain way, she is not the liberated person she would like to be.",1
37,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She will realize looks are everything after she lost her looks.,1
38,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What bothers me the most is that most models think they are pretty. <br>These cat walk models look like anorexic ghouls.....,1

40,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Blah blah.. white privilege.. blah blah blah... White privilege.. blah blah.,1
41,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; oh, but they are, 99% of the time. Ask people who have been judged most of their life  primarily based on their looks, it mattered less how good they were as human beings. Nice treatment pretty ladies and handsome men get is a very real thing specially in my society. I remember once a girl a told me don&#39;t act cool and intelligent because you won&#39;t get laid anyway because you don&#39;t have it, what she wanted to say that I was ugly, so I was not deserving.",1
42,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks and money shouldn&#39;t be everything, yet they are. Because no matter how much money you have, or how many people stop you on the street to talk or look at you. None of it will bring you true happiness.",1
43,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Money and looks buy stability not happiness.,1
44,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I have no idea who you are.  This did not need to be about ethnicity or color, that&#39;s irrelevant to the message of your insecurity and how to boost true self-image in all people everywhere...which is what I had hoped you were going to talk about...but did not.",1
45,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Anyway, I can&#39;t deny the advantages of being pretty because some jobs (maybe your or my dream) are only available for good-looking people.",1
46,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The problem with being insecure (atleast in my case) about your looks is the halo effect. As an attractive being youre perceived as healthy, successful, intelligent, open-minded, friendly etc. but if youre in that role you always fear that you dont come up to those expectations. So good looks (might) lead to insecurity about your body AND other attributes as well. I do know that I am attractive or at least above average but that does not help me at all. I am insecure about my intelligence and keep my mouth closed when I talk to a group of friends or strangers as I fear being exposed, I fear being reduced to my looks and I fear feeling that deep core feeling of sheer stupidity that I carry around every day. Looks arent everything and they will make some experiences even worse.",1
47,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How i wish one day i can also talk freely in that stage and the topic is &quot; try to look in the mirror naked &quot;,1
48,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! I won a genetic lottery and so what? I didn&#39;t have an obligation to be a model. I wanted to be my boss. I am a white, tall, pretty girl and so what? Don&#39;t try to order me because I want to do what I want. Lol.",1
49,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I heard about the Forwago and decided to give it a try. I am more than grateful for the plans which helped me to improve my physical and mental health. Definitely, I would recommend everybody to try it!",1
50,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I heard about the Forwago and decided to give it a try. I am more than grateful for the plans which helped me to improve my physical and mental health. Definitely, I would recommend everybody to try it!",1
51,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bring judged by looks is taxing no matter if people like your image or not.,1
52,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Most models are not very good looking.,1
53,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks might not be &quot;everything&quot;, but it&#39;s what people notice first. And we all do it. It&#39;s just human nature.<br><br>Also: only physically attractive people say things like &quot;looks don&#39;t matter&quot;. Just like only people who have money (or at least don&#39;t have to worry about money) say that &quot;money isn&#39;t everything.&quot;",1
54,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,sorry looks matter to me,1
55,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I didn&#39;t pick my parents and i&#39;ve paid for it my whole life and I&#39;d rather be dead. Some day...,1
56,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,nemli olan d gzelik deildir nemli olan i gzeliktir,1
57,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah but ur not a very good looking model sooo....,1
58,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She didn&#39;t have enough time to talk about what life is like for a supermodel. I admire her courage for getting up on a stage to speak instead of dancing down a runway, but I think the points she was trying to make got lost.",1
59,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Oh no... I thought being beautiful is the only thing that matters... Then I turned 10 years old,1
60,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,My ex girlfriend who was a lovely person was in better shape than her and she WASNT a model so shes already arrogant,1
61,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everybody judges a book by its cover..period,1
62,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Honest, funny, powerful and all in 9 mins, everyone whos obsessed with beauty, looks and modelling world should watch this! (Including myself in this, Ill probably need to rewatch it couple of times)",1
63,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I admire your honesty. At last someone who is willing to speak out, about an industry built on falsehood. I have never married because from an early age I was only ever attracted to stunningly beautiful women, and could never get one. Was I shallow, or was I brainwashed?",1
64,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"her speech is so ordinary comparing with other TED talkers, but she still can be there and make a speech just because of her outlooking, pathetic fact",1
65,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything...<br>Well nothing is everything...,1
66,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People with good looks : look doesn&#39;t matter<br>Ppl with lot of money: money doesn&#39;t matter<br>Ppl with good height : height doesn&#39;t matter,1

69,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks ARE everything and they have always been since the beginning of time. It&#39;s just a rule of life,1
70,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Model: Looks aren&#39;t everything, believe my pretty face &amp; perfect body.<br>Me a skinny guy: Meh!",1
71,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she doesnt deny her privilege,1
72,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are everything. Unfortunately.  The prettier you are the more doors open for you that is just facts.,1
73,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,U are not good looking so what r u even talking about. Models are fake. Just like you.,1
74,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,youre doing this TED talk because youre looking good. nothing else,1
75,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,LOL,1
76,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,TEDX just wanted to kidding everyone,1
77,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Only 27 were non-white button which country? Would that be the same in China or Indonesian or India or any country in Africa? Thats very subjective and it depends a lot on the local population. However no matter what country is likely 100% of them were good looking by any country standard,1
78,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Jesus is coming soon repent and turn to Jesus are you ready are you sure your saved? Have you spread Gods word yet?,1
79,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks arent everything<br>Yes, but they are something.",1
80,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t know whats up with the negative comments, this is an amazing presentation, she did it so well",1
81,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But if a man is only concerned with your looks and nothin else getting his attention is no prize being ugly weeds out the douche bags,1
82,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why she put dress over dress?,1
83,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Don&#39;t mind me my teacher forced me to watch this.,1
84,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Russell actually never said the title, if you listened to the talk, you&#39;ll learn that looks <i>are everything in her industry</i> .",1

86,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,O,1
87,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Grades arent everything. Believe me Im an A* student,1
88,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The title is misleading. Sadly, majority of the comments here are taking the title as what she&#39;s trying to convey - rather than listening what she&#39;s actually saying, and entirely missing the point. There&#39;s a reason as to why she pointed out her privilege of being a pretty, tall white woman and comparing it to the privileges of people with a different skin colour, cultural background, weight, or facial features; to show us the discrimination and injustices that people face on a daily basis.",1
89,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m confused about the point of this TedTalk. She&#39;s saying looks don&#39;t matter, but they do. Beauty is important. It changes everything but nothing changes it. I&#39;m an artist so it&#39;s the whole ball of wax to me.",1

While growing up I understood that most men in the Haitian culture preferred women with curves, specially the exaggeratedly big booty . Then I met people from the US and I recieved a lot of compliments for the same skinny body. <br>What I am saying is that: it&#39;s all about culture.

I&#39;m not thin and I see thin women all the time being treated like queens.  and yeah I know they could be insecure because of disgusting men.  but they have an easier life.  oh and it depends on the body type.  you can be an ectomorph which is when someone is Slim and can&#39;t get pudgy or whatever you call it. no matter what they eat.  Mesomorphs are in between, they can lose weight easily but gain it right back easily but they are curvy.  and lastly Endomorphs are people who have it the hardest they are super curvy but it&#39;s hard to lose weight.

143,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People, for fucks sake, looks really arent everything. Yes, a lot of you guys are right, they do matter, just not in the way that you guys think. Looks are poweful, they are a way to portray yourself in front of others. The way you dress, the expressions on your face, the way you stand, can all give a sense of power. But looking just like whats cool and popular and unrealistic, ruins that sense of power you could hold. Wearing makeup just because you think youre ugly, which youre not, and wearing clothes that you think will give you a pass to feeling accepted, even if you fucking hate them, is not what it means to be good looking. Going on diets so you can have a body that even models are probably making themselves miserable, and maybe even lying to you to have ruins it too. Models are pretty, yes, but they dont define what it means to be beautiful. Being pretty is a one sided term, only looking to the unrealistic, big picture standards of a being. Being beautiful means to be you, to be human. To feel, to be imperfect. Have you ever realized how you react to these two different terms? A typical reaction to being pretty is that you might feel good because it gives you a sense of false hope, and false joy. But it doesnt feel authentic. However, when youre called beautfiul, doesnt it sound more authentic? Genuine? Real? Dont you feel a better sense of joy when you hear the word alone? Thats what I mean. Dont beat yourself up for something that you cant control. You can still have good looks. You just need that sense of power in the way you hold and view yourself. It will change you. Truly. Looks dont define who you are. Theyre just the blank canvas for all of youre enigmatic colors! Sorry this is so long/: I hope it helps though.",1
144,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I hate this comment section. Im plus sized, and I think every single thing she said was well said and accurate. It was informative and she admitted to all of her privileges!",1
145,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Where can I find the whole talk please? She actually caught my attention with the racial injustice &amp; how young girls view themselves.,1
146,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel very sorry for her,1
147,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is a really good, meaningful TedTalk. I will be sharing it with my students.",1
148,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So here we have a model, that just happened to be unhappy. But her unhappiness had nothing to do with being a model, only with how she was being treated. I wonder how much more unhappy she would&#39;ve been if she wasn&#39;t a model.",1
149,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Really lady......,1
150,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is pretty...mmm,1
151,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Loks aren&#39;t all......yes true but we all see first with out eyes. We don&#39;t see the person&#39;s soul or character traits. Looks do make  people more appealing.,1
152,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lets see maybe in 20 years time when your beauty fades away, honey. Youll come back to your tedtalk video cause you miss the beautiful you. Cause, look really matters",1

157,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,9 mins wasted ,1
158,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Tbh all i hear is someone with everything express how they have problems too but they are shallow.<br>But then shes a model and talks about superficial but right after, she contradicts herself by admitting shes insecure about her looks?<br>Oh and then it was about race. Bam. Sudden beauty pageant.",1
159,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It is so easy to say that coz u have the looks, but ugly creatures just went silence",1
160,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s great. A lot of commenters here aren&#39;t.,1

167,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She isnt saying looks arent everything to say looks dont matter. Shes saying looks dont define your character and they SHOULDNT matter so much.,1
168,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Anyone who has ever been unattractive can tell you that looks do matter. A lot. I was a very ugly duckling who grew into my looks in my early 20s. There is no comparison between how I was treated before and after. It was night and day.<br><br>The difference between how youd imagine people would treat a disgusting alien lifeform and how people would treat royalty or someone magical. When youre attractive and dress to conceal it (no or intentionally bad makeup, frumpy clothes, bad posture) the way people treat you feels MEAN  but in reality, its just the absence of everyone bending over backwards for you. Its how every average person is treated, and better than ugly people are treated.<br><br>The world is so kind to me now, but Im still bitter. I havent forgotten how people treated me when I wasnt attractive. I was the same person. I was actually probably a better person when I was ugly: I was kinder, less vain, less judgmental. I tried to do good in the world. And none of that mattered. All that matters is how you look.",1

171,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In the age of majoritarian belligerence and the open flaunting of majoritarian way of life, one from that pack is soothingly candid.

189,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Smelling some salty comments here... She IS admitting to her privilege and that its not fair so why not thank her for what she is doing instead of criticizing her?,1

192,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She had some great points and a very well done video but the title is completely misleading.,1
193,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow there are a lot of toxic comments here since I last saw it.say what you want but her photo comparisons are eye opening,1
194,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This video wouldnt have too much attention, if instead of this model wouldve talked an ugly person . Thats hipocrisy by our society",1
195,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,people who deny a specific ability or feature or thing are perfect in that field...e.g. Jeff bezos says money doesn&#39;t matter or warren buffet says the same words. it&#39;s quite ironic...LOLL,1
196,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Its becoming like a trend for beautiful women to say  Im insecure  i believe its rude because i think they say it so average women think oh look at her shes perfect and she Also has insecurities so i wont envy her, shes just like me when in reality beautiful women know they are privileged",1

198,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, but easier to say for a model than an average looking person.",1

201,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks play important role in life......Never believe when people say &quot; looks doesn&#39;t matter &quot; bcz their actions are true reflection of their thinking and 99% people ignore uh if you are ugly.,1

207,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Some of you clearly did not watch the video and just jumped straight to the comments section to complain about the title lol,1
208,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Me : <b>trying to find good comments</b><br>The comments : <br>Models : looks aren&#39;t everything <br>Rich ppl : money isn&#39;t everything,1
209,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Maybe the worst TED talk of all time? She has the self-awareness of a 16 year-old.,1

221,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are only everything to people who make it everything. This would make sense in the modelling and fashion industry and for people who have gone through bullying and insecurities. Looks arent everything, is just a superficial and small part of life. Most of us will grow old or die somewhat suddenly. When we die, well probably be ugly with our saggy skin, bent back and receding hairlines. And someday we will decay into a stinking rotten mass in the earth",1
222,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,to me the problem is that people should not need to told all the is is superficial everyone knows the pictures are touched up and photo shop when you are trying to sell clothes to white women then it makes sense to have white models am sure in parts of the world where the people are predominantly black then black models would be better so are all fashion shows in African nations full of white models is that how it goes don&#39;t really know we don&#39;t need Ted Talks to send our kids down the right path we need Parents Talks tell your kids what the real world is like teach them that looks aren&#39;t everything if i had a daughter i would not want her to listen too this drivel,1

232,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love how she is opening talking about her race and her body type benefited. I love that she is honest about it. She was talking about this in 2013 and still in 2021 we are struggling with these issues. Atleast she made people become aware of the inequality.,1

286,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything lol says by a model. Its like bill gates saying money aren&#39;t everything.,1
287,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Is there a point to this talk?,1
288,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks arent everything to a pretty face because theyve never been the ugly one lol,1
289,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Models aren&#39;t definitively good looking. They just adhere to trends of acceptability. It&#39;s gross.,1

292,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So much negativity in the comments. She is not denying that she benefited from the looks, she literally said that in the talk. She also said its hard to benefit from the system yet try to speak against it now. The reason she is doing that is because she sees it on the other side that this system breeds insecurity and injustice. It is not her responsibility as an individual to fix the system or the way society works. On the other hand, she is using her advantage and this platform to spread this msg.",1
293,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Rich people: money is worth nothing.<br>Attractive people: looks aren&#39;t everything.,1
294,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I never understood people saying &quot;looks doesn&#39;t matter&quot; money doesn&#39;t matter&quot; by rich and models, but they spend their whole life getting rich and beautiful",1

296,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just here for the comments. If she&#39;s ugly she won&#39;t be a model would she?,1
297,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lol looks are everything. In life if you dont look good youre at the bottom of the life chain. If ur a guy and you dont look good or have money. You might as well end ur life then and there,1
298,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"you rock, thanks for your help and be youre self.",1
299,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Money isnt everything. Believe me Im rich.<br>Food isnt everything. Believe me Im stuffed.<br>Air isnt everything. Believe me Im not drowning.<br><br>Who are you to say something like this, if you have what people want.",1
300,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t understand what she is saying. She said that we are biologically attracted to certain types of people and especially their skin color. Then does that mean she wants to reprogram our biological taste in what we find attractive? I don&#39;t find a 3 foot 200lb person attractive. Nor do I find a person with 10 fingers on one hand or a person who is cross eyed attractive. Should I be reprogrammed to find those traits attractive?,1
301,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,hmm,1
302,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"And thats the reason this video is the fifth most watched on this channel...while the ones which talk about lets say quantum physics, environmental sustainability, global health crisis etc all lie in the dusted corners but, I agree, looks arent anything, like I was selected in an interview where I was dressed really sharp, good 63 tall guy with a toned body, but hey, looks dont matter..",1

313,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Even though she is saying looks do matter, but they shouldn&#39;t. Is she telling people anything they don&#39;t already know? Yes, I know we live in a superficial society; yes, I know that hypocrisy is at the heart of how we treat people by their appearance - but does this change anything? No. Why not? Because we are hard-wired to respond to beauty in the same way we are hard-wired to be repulsed by ugliness. Nothing will change until such time as people have radical changes made to our minds, and I don&#39;t see that happening soon.",1

316,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I commend you for speaking on a subject that not many would dare speak of. Especially from those who are in that business, but i ask you to never apologize for who or into what culture you were born into. I agree that our value should not be based on our appearance. Shame on those individuals who do value someone by their appearance but shame on those who use it to their advantage. Theyll get what they give, that is a fact. And when the one who creates comes do judge I hope that they remember who they brought misfortune to. Even those who dont believe will be judged by Him and He has said Hell do it to their face.",1

321,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I get that she is kinda nervous but like i can hear her breath so hard.....,1
322,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Up to my early 30s I took it for granted that people treated me really nicely for who I am. I thought that&#39;s just what people did. Then I lost my hair in my mid 30s and people, very quickly, stopped being that extra nice to me. <br>The truth hit me like a brick wall.",1

330,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"lmao, get the F outta here.<br><br>This is like the rich people that say money doesn&#39;t buy happiness, proceeds to hop in their huge car while others walk home in rain and mud. And the one that has medical bills, nah don&#39;t worry money won&#39;t make you happy ;)",1
331,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I can feel that the audience is so uncomfortable by your beauty!,1
332,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah but would she be attracted to a guy who is not attractive? Just curious, Im not really doubting her sincerity",1
333,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Even I believe looking good is not everything.... But the problem is those who are good looking think, looks are everything",1
334,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If normal people could be used as models there won&#39;t be any insecurity of getting fat,1
335,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why does she breath so hard when she laughs?,1
336,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes looks aren&#39;t everything. But sure it doesn&#39;t hurt to be healthy and well groomed along with a genuine smile.,1
337,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great job You&#39;re beautiful and that&#39;s OK, you were born that way Thanks for making me laugh and don&#39;t pay attention to the haters!",1
338,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What was the purpose of that TED Talk?,1
339,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s easy to stink when your trousers are full. (Austrian saying).... 27m clicked on the video -I am pretty sure: if a black female person, who did not win the gene lottery, would have shared her view, how her first 20 years in life were ... not many would not have shown the same interest. and I am not sure this video will change a lot",1

341,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The irony is, most of these &quot;models&quot; aren&#39;t particularly good looking, including this one. I don&#39;t know why these sort of looks are chosen to sell stuff so much. You can make yourself look much better simply with well-fitting clothes and good posture in real life, which is quite a different world to professional photography. As a not-particularly-attractive man, I can apologise my way out of doing twice the speed limit too.",1
342,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I used to have a very asymmetrical nose. I broke it as a child it seems and it got really bad during growth spurts. I am lucky to have parents who could afford the surgery.

345,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Anyway..<br>a great honest talk that goes beyond &quot;looks are not important&quot;,1
346,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes not just looks.. Money too ,1
347,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"to women, MONEY is everything. if a man doesn&#39;t have money, they don&#39;t want them. if a man isn&#39;t good looking and not rich, they are not interested. its funny how women say looks aren&#39;t everything, but sadly is is part of it, money is the other part. kindness has nothing to do with it. if a man isn&#39;t good looking a woman won&#39;t even give them a minute of a day.",1
348,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That it didnt make you happy is an important point which some feminists forget when they evaluate the level of justice an individual white male has earned by the standards of their identity class.,1

And by better yourself I dont mean look better, by better yourself I mean try to be the best possible person you can be, try to be a personality. Everyone would want to be around a person who is always positive, smiling and fun. And in those instances were people do judge you entirely on your looks, even if you are currently happy with yourself, they are the problem, not you. You can be accepted for other reasons than looks.

I wonder who she mates with - an average looking guy with an above average intelligence, or a 99th percentile looking douche with an average job. Or an ugly fat guy with a shitload of money to maintain her status. My money is on the last one. At least she would be true to the title of her presentation.

If you want to have a happy life, you&#39;ve got to do some serious thinking. Life is not about being happy, it&#39;s about finding out how you can make life meaningful, and then pursue that; if happiness comes along the way while doing that, then that&#39;s great, but don&#39;t pursue happiness alone, that&#39;s just an idiotic shallow thing to do. Maybe her intentions are good, but, the things she says don&#39;t make much sense. The way she dresses and acts doesn&#39;t correspond with what she says, therefore she doesn&#39;t mean what she says, which is sad but true.

She is very full of hereself and all she did was &quot;cry&quot; because she won the genetic loterry. She has issues... <br>And being a model is a passion for some people.",1

471,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I thing that generalizing things is wrong. It is all about perspective imo. For example, if I am super rich and say that money is not important, that does not mean that should not be important or is not important for everyone else.  For a guy that struggles with personal finance money is very important and it would make him happier when he solve his finance problems. Another example, I like cars for driving pleasure, performance etc. and for me cars are important and make me happy, but to some people who are not into cars, cars are just machines that drive them from point A to point B. Same here, she just presented her perspective, from her experience and her point of view and that is cool. But it does not mean that other models in her industry think and feel the same.",1

476,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;I just totally transformed what you thought of me in 6 seconds.&quot; Yeah that&#39;s exactly the type of thought I would think a model would have. <br><br>but at least she had time to virtue signal to relieve some of that white guilt she inherited from that legacy she is referring to. Of course while completely ignoring the fact that asian women are statistically universally considered to be some of the most beautiful in the world. The 4th highest paid model in the world is puerto rican. the 7th chinese.  <br><br>Scientifically speaking beyonce is the second most beautiful woman in the world because of how closely her face complies to the golden ratio. Not to mention beauty is in the eye of the beholder because the woman that scored higher than beyonce, bella hadid, I don&#39;t even think she is pretty let alone the most beautiful woman in the world. <br><br>How about you just realize the reason the fashion industry is filled with white models...is because that is who they are marketing to...we live in America that is 70% white and everyone is competing for the biggest market. It doesn&#39;t take a giant racist conspiracy to figure this out. It doesn&#39;t mean it is more difficult for a non white person to be considered beautiful. It just means it&#39;s more difficult for them to find a job in an industry that does not think they need them...which is basically like every other job on the planet. it&#39;s not like roseanne barr is getting a modeling gig over tyra banks. I thought ted talks were supposed to make you think not kill brain cells.<br><br>&quot;Smile and look pretty honey, thinking clearly isn&#39;t going to be your bread and butter&quot; probably the best advice she ever got.",1

Not only is it harmful to the rest of humanity, it&#39;s harmful to yourself because you admitted that your livelihood exacerbates your own level of insecurity. She might as well work for big tobacco, in that her livelihood perpetuates and exacerbates physical and psychological distress (i.e. anxiety, depression, addiction, etc.)  which are two of the most compelling motivators to consume more products that inevitably engenders feelings of pain and distress (which essentially leads to addictive thoughts and behaviors).",1

It is a perfectly natural process that does no harm and gives men pleasure. There is absolutely no shame in it. Of course, no-one in their right mind would claim women have to be in perfect shape 24 hours a day, every day, or that an emotional connection along with the physical attraction is not as important, but let&#39;s not jump to the opposite side and say that any man who admires a woman for her body is the &quot;wrong type of man&quot;.

708,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"At my job, all the attractive girls and guys are on the top floor (Important one)<br>As you go down floors, the people get uglier and uglier. <br>Coincidence?",1
709,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Tell that to today&#39;s modern obsession with looks, they are being taught to be like that through television and social media. Shameless vanity is through the roof. Although to actual genuine people, it&#39;s what&#39;s on the inside that matter, that&#39;s what makes someone attractive. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there needs to be a surface attraction for me to become interested in a woman, but it&#39;s only part of the equation. But the &#39;supermodel&#39; look, certainly isn&#39;t attractive at all.",1
710,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow. She felt guilty about her looks and skin color. And it&#39;s like she was asking to forgive her that she could make money out of this. She was very insecure back then...,1
711,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Sorry but this isn&#39;t about looks this is about modeling. Big difference.<br>Most &quot;looks&quot; that people find attractive are tied to superior genetics. <br>Yes personality matters and can make the difference between a strange a friend or a lover but it&#39;s one half of a whole which includes look.<br>....you wouldn&#39;t fall in love with someone you wouldn&#39;t want to bang. If most people think you look bad or even average the relationship opportunities you have with those people are bad or average. <br>Some people want to be the president or ceo of a company yes. But that&#39;s different for everyone. Whats the same is we all want a lover and friends and to be happy and have fun. Looks give you a guaranteed avenue for those things. <br>For example how many of us guys would be willing to give her a shot? Now how many of you would be willing to give Angela Merkel a shot? She&#39;s in charge of Germany thats impressive right?,1

725,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think some of us are missing one of the biggest takeaways from this message.  What most of us perceive as perfect, ideal, desirable.   Is nothing more than a collaborated product of illusions, tricks, in other words, fake.  That final picture we see out of 1k taken in a photo session,  undergoes many hours of editing.  When in all reality, we tend to missed some of the most beautiful attributes an individual has to offer.  Little things like humor, intellect, humbleness, courage, insightfulness...  she is so beautiful!  And not because of her looks.  Her soul is beautiful,  her outer shell just gets in the way of her true beauty.",1

734,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Models are part of the perception problem.,1
735,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I feel like a lot of ppl don&#39;t get the point.. Yes many things are easier when you are beautiful and we all know it.. But other problems come with it. Nobody has a perfect life, each person&#39;s life has its own pros and cons. you can have an &quot;average life&quot; but have people who love you around you, being healthy, having a secured job, have a loving wife etc.. on the other hand you can be &quot;successful&quot; have money, fame, cars, be beautiful, but you are gonna have the pressure of always being nice and take time for your fans, or paparazzis cuz you are a public figure, be a role model, perform if you are an athlete, put out great songs if u are an artist, and also feel lonely because with fame and money come the gold diggers, the fake friends, and fake people from those industries. What she is saying is that yes it makes a difference, in a positive way, and in a bad way at the same time, she is saying that there is no cheat code in life,achieving or having one thing is not gonna give you the whole package.",1
736,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"well, she isnt even that attractive, she just has a sellable face<br>that&#39;s not the woman i dream of at night, that&#39;s the woman i see on an ad<br>dont get attractiveness and marketability confused<br>and no her outfit switch didnt change anything for me<br>still seeing a fragile tall skinny woman with low self esteem<br>thats why girls shouldnt pursue modeling carreers",1

758,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I concur. <br>A model or some kind of celebrity status its not actually who they are. That&#39;s just a character created for a particular purpose. <br>They got 23 other hours of the day when they&#39;re just a regular human doing the sane things you are.,1

In my head I was like well he had the self confidence but look at that it did not work out. My girlfriend tried to tell me these ladies are just this and that.

Because it is then that you become desperate and turn and ask for support from those who care, and so many offer absolutely zero sympathy, because you were a winner for so many years and they seize their opportunity to dump their saved-up envy and emotional vengeance onto you, make you feel like your overwhelming sense of loss should be instead thankfulness, or guilt, or even shame.",1

791,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There certainly doesn&#39;t seem to be a middle ground on this TED post.  Commenters seem to be very supportive or very critical.  And with over 25k comments its certainly a push-button issue.<br>I for one, think at the very least she&#39;s being honest.  And at one point somewhat self-deprecating, when she tells about how phony the &quot;walking pose while looking back over her shoulder at nothing&quot; (paraphrasing) feels to her.  I think her point is, she&#39;s telling us she doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s anything special, and yes, she knows she&#39;s getting paid well for something she didn&#39;t &quot;earn.&quot;<br>It seems most of the negative comments dwell on this last aspect.  Who&#39;s to say she didn&#39;t made a decision to take advantage of her situation so she could have the wherewithal, financial and otherwise, to pursue avocations and activities important to her, that actually move her soul and help others?  As long as she doesn&#39;t mistreat other humans on her life&#39;s journey, who are we to criticize her for this?<br>Beautiful people, especially women, do have more doors open to, and for, them.  Conversely, the toughest path is probably that of what most of us would call the physically unattractive woman.  There&#39;s a TED talk from Lizzie Velasquez that addresses this last issue.

863,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I am bit late to a party here but trust me looks are pretty important if you dont look good nobody cares about who you are. Speaking from my own experience i used to be overweight then I get around 10% fat percent with strong jawline high cheekbones and six packs. The way they treat me is so much better when I was fat,1

She&#39;s imagined herself in the shoes of someone who hasn&#39;t won the &quot;lottery&quot; and knows how bullshit it is. If she was in reality in those shoes then the message of this ted talk would be different as it would look like someone asking society to to treat them better / look like someone asking for more. Most of these comments that state that less superificially good-looking people all want to look good are saying what everyone already knows. She&#39;s giving us the unique perspective of someone on the other side looking from the outside. It&#39;s evident that people look down on her insight because of her appearance.",1

902,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Gee she has it all...,1
903,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Factually, yes, looks aren&#39;t everything. Looks can&#39;t compensate wholly for a lack of intelligence/intellect, personality, drive, ambition, good values, morals, etc.<br>BUT looks do make life easier. People are generally more attracted to you initially. It helps gain an edge in social interactions and relationships. Makes people like you more, esp if you&#39;re even mildly kind and interesting. Good looking people also tend to struggle much less with self esteem issues, esp when growing up. You naturally feel better about yourself when you look good and get feedback on it often. You feel desired and wanted. Maybe it leads to more romantic experiences which bolster even more self confidence. You feel more like a &quot;man&quot; or &quot;woman,&quot; and sexually confident. It may be shallow at times, but attention is attention. We all crave it to some degree.",1
904,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks might not seem like everything, if you are spectacularly good looking.  This reminds me of millionaires telling people that money isn&#39;t everything.  When you have a ton of a precious commodity, it is easy to take it for granted, even though you are one millionth of a percent of all of humanity.  Be happy you were born with spectacular beauty, don&#39;t be ashamed of it.  Own it.",1
905,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To those making comments along the lines of &quot;Millionaire: Money isn&#39;t imlortant&quot; you have missed the point. A millionaire is the most qualified to make that judgement. They may be lonely, depressed or struggle in different ways. One thing that people forget is that money can isolate you as people envy and resent you. You can also become a target. Money isnt everything but poverty is a real problem.",1
906,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I applaud her for playing her cards well and being humble while doing so, however diluting her accomplishments via perceived social benefit, whether real or imigined, does very little to encourage personal responsibility, and instead serves to cripple the inner strength of so many who believe they were dealt a bad hand.

Do you think that insecurity comes only from look? What about people who have a lower IQ or skills in a job? from a lawyer to a teacher, from a comedian to a salesman? Insecurity is not caused only by one&#39;s skin colour or physical look. <br>3- The game is not about gender or race, it is about what drives the circulation and the money. It is called Capitalism. One (look) becomes trendy today, and once it&#39;s consumed they move on and create another. It is this girl&#39;s vanity that she thinks &quot;she is privileged because she is white and pretty. <br>4- What a hypocrisy: It is excellent and fine while making money. Where was your brain? Oh, yes, what an innocent little!!! -who kept her innocence for 10 years and made good money and lived a good life. Oh sorry, it was not that easy... What a torture was wearing these high heels!<br><br>What a pretentious confession. Did you find the church on your own?

994,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She spends the first minute assuming that a) everyones thinking about her, b) she knows what theyre thinking, and c) everyone, especially her sisters, are envious of her. Get over yourself, love. You really arent all that.",1

1007,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What&#39;s awkward is that she makes fun of herself. She&#39;s almost perfect looking. It gets interesting when she speaks about getting free stuff for her looks. That is a rare kind of vulnerability coming out of her. The kind we don&#39;t get to see. She&#39;s been exploited. No matter how good it seems she does seem insecure because she hasn&#39;t had to learn how to treat herself differently, where she&#39;s more in control. I&#39;d like to hear her go further with that.",1

Actually, it can be difficult and hard.  I always feel guilty for my looks.  I actually had people say things like,  &quot;You&#39;re different from your family.  You got all the good genes.&quot;  Or one of my sisters will introduce me as their sister and you can actually see the shock on their face and they look back and forth at us comparing one to another.   AwKwArD.  I minimize and hide my looks in front of my family.  One way I hide is to gain weight.  If I put on the pounds no one will see me and no one will compare me to my siblings like they normally do.  If I lose weight, I get the comments and it&#39;s more than I can take sometimes.  I feel guilty for being blessed with the genes I have and feel I can&#39;t really be myself around them sometimes.  I&#39;ve actually never talked out loud about it.  This would be my unveiling (so to speak).  To be honest, I&#39;m tired of feeling guilt because of my looks and really just want to be the person I am meant to be.  Thank you for sharing your story.  I hear you.",1

1283,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=4m05s"">4:05</a> You CAN&#39;T be the president of the United States if you are born outside of the US. Its a fact, its the law",1
1284,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think we forget that good looking people are people,1
1285,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Someone so honest.... ahhhhh may be humanity still exist,1
1286,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"ACTUALLY to all the ugly people in comments.. the better looking you are the &quot;WORSE&quot; you are treated by everyone because they either harbor disdain for you or expect you to be confident people with their lives in order... you just pretend good looking people have privilege because it makes you feel better about giving up on bettering yourself, you WANT to keep ur excuse that its because you&#39;re not good looking that your life sucks",1
1287,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lots of people in the comments are saying she isn&#39;t in the position to talk about beauty not mattering because she is beautiful. Did you even watch the video or listen to a single thing she is saying? What is wrong with you?,1
1288,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is one of my favorite Ted Talks,1
1289,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is spot on. Her honest statements shows she is intelligent and intuitive. I have met women who were good looking and had the brains of a retarded flea. Others had charm, smarts, a great sense of humor and had class. To me that beats a body and face that will grow old with time. Looks are a short time investment if that&#39;s all you&#39;ve got.",1
1290,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think the title was a polarizing factor for a lot of people and a lot of the reason why these comments can be so negative was how the words were interpreted. However had it not been as polarizing a title, one could say that there would not be so many views for this talk, in this case, if it was on purpose, well done. She was very real in understanding her privilege and the essential aspects of modeling and image. However her viewpoint in itself was one that sparks controversy because it is a reality no one wants to admit. No one is happy with their image, and having a different one isn&#39;t going to be able to change that fact.",1
1291,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I honestly thought the comment section was so beautiful and intelligent but then I changed the setting to &quot;newest comments first&quot;,1
1292,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I did change my thinking when she change her clothes. At first I thought wow she is gorgeous and she talked how appearance should not matter. But look how she looks. And now when she wear the comfortable wear that we all wear I change my mind. Well she is just one of us. Its okay for her to talk about looks now. But not when she is all gorgeous and on stage,1
1293,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Anyway, she&#39;s beautiful",1
1294,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Don&#39;t athletes and really smart people also cash in on their DNA?,1
1295,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Models are insecure, I didn&#39;t know that! Her honesty is much appreciated, it gives us  a new perspective.",1
1296,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You can still see in her talk 1) shes still in love with being hot, 2) she hasnt learn how not to be nervous out of the model arena, and 3) she still full of contradictions about looks. Sad.",1
1297,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Re-watching this after seeing the suicide rates for pre-teens and teens skyrocket nearly 150% since 2011. Really goes to show how toxic, addictive, and horrific social media is for a young mind. The best thing you can do for your child is not allow them to have social media until they are developed enough to understand the power of it.",1

I&#39;m old and I&#39;m a physician and I don&#39;t hate her because she&#39;s prettier than I ever was.  I went to medical school at a time when women in medicine was rare; 8% of my class was female.  My career had its ups and downs.  We forget that everyone else has their ups and downs as well.  Sometimes people we think have it all are insecure, lonely, and frightened.  Just think of how many celebrities suffer from addictions or die from anorexia or suicide.",1

Se tu costringi il creato gli fai violenza. Il creato pu essere violentato ma il suo risentimento si esprime deformando il vaso in cui lo costringi.,1
1308,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Dobbiamo considerare che la donna e tutta la sua progenie fu plasmata da un po di terra con certe sue caratteristiche di crescita in moto avvitamento avanti retro. Con il peccato la donna non  una persona. Un vaso. Ma io dico un sacco floscio. Pu rimpirlo con ci che trover, alle condizioni serventi necessarie. E quindi prendere una forma, anche modella bellina, desiderata. Nella sostanza sempre un sacco floscio che si deve riempire. Diversa  la luce che  uno spirito. Essa sceglie di solito un sacco floscio vuoto e senza residui vi si installa e ne prende la forma. Va da s che tutto il creato si orienta da s verso la luce. Se tu metti una creatura al buio e poi vede una luce si orienta da s in quella direzione. E&#39; una legge di Dio.",1

When she put on the more casual clothes, well I am certain that most guys just thought, oh it is an attractive woman in not so attractive clothes. It does not matter. What can yourself do. Well exercise and workout, dress good. But really we cant change bone structure, face structure, symmetry in face and other things. There are people who will not spend 2 seconds with you just based on your looks. Is that persons you want to hang around, well does not matter.

1358,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She should have had more that nine and a half minutes to talk. It seemed she had so much to say and could have used more time to elaborate on her points. I did really like her use of the slides: for humor and to show her in real life verses her in magazines. I also like how she acknowledged her privilege. Stating how there are so many people not as lucky as her. But that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s got it perfect. I hope we get to hear more from her later.,1

She didn&#39;t lie in any part of her speech. Neither did she say that being a model isn&#39;t great! And, of course, this speech is a huge cliche... but, it&#39;s so not her fault. It&#39;s yours. It&#39;s yours to think that way. It&#39;s the fault of that cop and that shop owner and the legacy. So stop thinking that way. It will take time. But, maybe it&#39;s possible.

I always thought modeling is about getting naked having a white-skinned sexy body with showing while people take pictures of you in short clothing and making sexual poses with your opposite gender. I liked her speech but women make themself feel insecure when they decide to have skinnier thighs to make themselves more appealing. Some women want to be sexually acknowledged so thus modeling or models pursue these images for them to recreate a goal or vision for them to set as standard. Am I right?,1

These &quot;constructions,&quot; as you call them, that aren&#39;t real, yet men drool over them as of they are. Men compare their girlfriends and wives to these images, and even if they don&#39;t say anything, we still see them looking, and so we look and punish ourselves for our inability to be that good.<br><br>I was anorexic as a teenager, and I STILL struggle with food avoidance and laxative abuse. I work out at least 3 hours a day. I drink as much water and as many meals as I can to avoid calories. I obsess over every label. I did organ damage to myself. I had a chance to start a local modeling career, but I said NO because I don&#39;t want to be the woman another girl looks at and punishes herself to try to become.<br><br>Yes, you were dealt a good hand, but it was your choice what you did with it, and you chose to get up there and be just another cog in the wheel, another reason why this vicious cycle will never end. For as long as the thinnest and prettiest women keep getting up there for the world to look at, girls like me -- that 12 year old looking at Seventeen Magazine -- will keep hating themselves for not being able to be that.<br><br>People, we PAY these women to be FAKE and then we ADMIRE them!

1399,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is the most pointless speech that I&#39;ve ever seen on TED. I&#39;m not sure if she wants to talk about the white standard of beauty or the discrepancy between she as a model and she who she really is.,1

She got a job out of her appearance, free stuff, I&#39;m sure she also had pretty guys talking to her so what&#39;s the drawback that she&#39;s insecure? Boo hoo me too big deal. I agree that there are more things to worry about other than looks but looks are a big plus in any situation.",1

Good luck, because there aren&#39;t many. I even wrote one company and asked them why all of the characters were white. I received a letter telling me that the company &quot;believed in diversity and that the office was diverse (the company originated in India)&quot;. I wrote back congratulating them but also stated that 1. I can&#39;t see this &quot;diverse office&quot; and 2. That is obviously not translating into the game itself. But the company understands this: &quot;White sells.&quot; We have become so conditioned to this that we don&#39;t even notice until...we have to. <br>This was a great TED talk.

Only when people who have experienced something, speak of it, does it inspire and motivate(which is the motive of the talk), otherwise it&#39;s bullshit that a)doesn&#39;t have any positive effect b) only let&#39;s people who&#39;re already at the top feel better about themselves for being &#39;good and humble and be applauded for that while others at the top copy and feel woke&#39;. Hence, the &#39;jeff Bezos:money doesn&#39;t matter &#39; comments aren&#39;t &#39;negative&#39; as a lot of you label them. It&#39;s people rightly displeased by the video.

1536,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s easy for her to say that because she isn&#39;t stuck in a work of modern art. Life will always be easier for good looking people, humanity has evolved to have a bias towards attractiveness and will let many negative things slip away just because of the looks.",1

1543,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Uh? What the heck? Why are there some people being bothered by her profession? Isnt it natural that people inside an industry themselves understand the most how there can be facts that contradict popular myths?

Because in &quot;show-off&quot; business (as Jamie Lee Curtis so aptly puts it), your reputation is based on and you earn your living by looking good. In an industry where there&#39;s always a search for a new &quot;lottery winner&quot;, it places significant pressure on those already in it because they&#39;re constantly expected to maintain an image and a persona that is not real. This many times spirals into serious mental health issues.<br><br>Unfortunately, the world never validates their cries because we, also living in a superficial world, grow up believing that persons with symmetrical faces have it all and any issue they have is just a whine.

1564,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are not everything but most of it.  I am rectally ugly.  I have never made a true girlfriend.  I have never made a true friend. The beautiful people saw my loneliness and used it to their advantage to gain my trust. That was early 1999.  By 8 August 2000, they fake girlfriend and false friends got hat they wanted from me and painfully abandoned me.  I realised it was a group coordination between my take girlfriend and false friends to get what they wanted from me then leave.  A few weeks later, they tried to get back into my life again.  After having learned my lesson that most beautiful people see the loneliness in ugly people and try to use them, I did not let a single one into my life again.  I never spoke to any of them again.  I deleted all of them from my life never to allow anybody else into my life again.  I am ugly and know they attacked me because they were beautiful and knew I felt great when they approached me for amicable and amorous relationships. It I was not ugly, I would have been treated more respectfully and more genuinely.  Being ugly is very hard.  But I simplified it by not socialising at all.  I only interact with humans in a manner that a client would interact with a merchant or servce provider and as short as possible.

In almost every country that said culture/race will think people of that same skin tone or culture is more attractive. Black men think black women are more attractive than white men think that black women are. Thats completely obvious. And it also sounds like shes assuming that white people are inherently more attractive societally? I find many latino/hispanic/asian girls just as or even more attractive than white girls. And this obviously differs by person. Race is simply a non issue in this conversation.,1

1643,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Where tf are all these hate comments that people are talking about, Jesus...",1
1644,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks arent everything. Tell that to the bearded lady,1
1645,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks, money, Fame aren&#39;t everything.<br><br>But they&#39;re the majority.",1

1647,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is same as rich people saying, money isnt everything",1
1648,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Real beauty comes from within!<br>It&#39;s high time that all of us understand this...<br>If we really understand what true beauty is..then automatically we will respect and love all the creatures in this universe,1
1649,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah live the life of being ugly and you will know that looks do matter so fucking much,1
1650,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"why is everybody writing stuff like &quot;why is everyone hating her?&quot; Well, cause thats humanity. Straight to the point. She even made some points clear in that regard. <br>Anyway, she`s one of the greatest souls on earth!",1
1651,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just something for you people to think about: Its common for work spaces not to hire good looking girls because they distract.,1
1652,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The honesty is refreshing and appreciated and the points are thought out too. The topic is now especially relevant many years later in terms of privilege and race. High five to the youtube/google algorithm for putting this in my path, haha.",1
1653,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a model? Shouldn&#39;t this ted be coming from an ugly person who overcame that?,1
1654,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Didn&#39;t watch the video but just going to say. Duh,1
1655,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If a less genetically gifted person said this nobody would be clicking on it, ironic isn&#39;t it.",1
1656,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That we have to state the obvious and it&#39;s considered insight is a sad commentary on our society.,1
1657,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I had a stunning co-worker who always had people commenting that she should be a model - she was working to be a criminal psychiatrist. She took it in her stride, but I felt for her. It&#39;s like a passing a genius in the street but he&#39;s homeless so nobody cares.<br><br>Books need to be read, not just looked at.",1
1658,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol what clowns thumbed this down?,1
1659,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its not all about looks its also about stamina oooiooh yeeeee. Uh uh uh uh,1
1660,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This title and video completely bullshit. I have overweight since my childhood and always refused by females. Being honest and polite is meaningless when you asked a date to a woman. Because if you don&#39;t have a &quot;tight&quot; body the answer is always the same, NO. So stop lying to people. YOUR WORDS DO NOT MATCH WITH THE REALITIES. Looks are everything and money follows it.",1
1661,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is hilarious. Very courageous and intelligent. Cameron Russell for President.,1
1662,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;i can say deep down, the most beautiful people are the ones that are the most self-concious. i&#39;ve met a fair share of models and they&#39;re like the pinacle of what is expected of all humans, and they&#39;ve reached it, they have it, but they all hate themselves. it&#39;s this bizare thing. they&#39;re all super sad, they&#39;re all super self-concious, yet according to most peoples logic they should be obsessed with themselves. they should be over the moon when they look in the mirror. but that just isn&#39;t the case.&quot;<br>a quote by conan gray which stuck with me for the past year and some time",1
1663,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"As of 2020, i could say that looks ARE everything rightnow.",1

1681,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Everyone seems to be insecure nowadays, busy comparing themselves to other people. There&#39;s always people better and worse off than us in one way or another. Why bother? Just focus on growing and bettering yourself. Stop judging others (and yourself) over what nobody has control over. Genetic lottery. The world is blinded by the superficial, and change starts with You.",1
1682,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"As weird as it may sound to most others, i personally dont like Models, most of them just seem to be an empty case, so im happy to be convinced that not all are. You were right, Cameron, u changed my view of you, not with changing your clothes, but with what u said.",1
1683,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s obviously smart as well as good looking. I wonder, if she had to choose, would she rather be smart or good looking,?",1
1684,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Who is here in 2020. Ms. Russell was certainly a couple of years ahead of time.,1
1685,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Well I believe if people are with you bz of looks then they aren&#39;t worth to be around you.,1
1686,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The reason why looks are important to people is because of the evoloutionary trait passdd on to us by thousands of years. Thereby creating a better stronger offsprings. Simple..!,1
1687,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I learned &quot;APPEARANCE IS NOT ALL&quot;.,1
1688,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes money isn&#39;t everything and look isn&#39;t everything. Indeed, it&#39;s true. You&#39;re all missing she&#39;s handeling a profession, no one looked at her and said &#39;Wow she didn&#39;t have a boyfriend at the time, where were I?&#39;. No one cares who she is inside, and doubtfully anyone from her close relationships. No one among you all, who have built a successful life within encouraging, warm and building family with a spouse and children don&#39;t even dare to look and think how those stories are alike. You don&#39;t have a clue what&#39;s it like to be insecure. To pass the credit only to your success. To not have anyone REAL in your life, a second half like most of you have. With whom you can run stupid stuff, be yourself, create a family and just be silly. This is a whole new world, different value and with different things people are fighting for. Her world is not your world. The struggles are different. And it&#39;s hard to understand and hard to realize that. And trust me eventhough I&#39;m not the most fabulous nor the most richest kind of guy in the world, since I pursued a couple of things in my life I&#39;d rather be your kind of the world, rather than her one. And darn I miss my old good days and my family life is not sufficient.",1
1689,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,We are the most insecure women on the planet (aaaand we also earn a lot of money and privilege that comes with the money). I would be glad if she discussed this topic with a Philippino woman who is trying to feed her 6 children on 2 bucks per day that she earns on a Nike factory for working 16 hour shift. Or a Pakistani girl who was married to a 43 old guy when she was 12. Or any other of millions of women who doesn&#39;t even understand the unimaginable psychological strain that this millionaire girl is going through.,1
1690,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I mean rich people will never truely feel and understand poor peaple,1
1691,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She seems pretty intelligent actually.,1
1692,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,shes not even pretty in the face lmao she also got a average looking body. shes not fat and not too skinny.. average..... she in no way got a nice butt nor bigger nicer boobs,1
1693,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just when I thought she was going to tell us more , it ended ! I think she hasn&#39;t even gone into her main story.",1
1694,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Her changing on the stage in front of the audience seems so unnecessary and even very cringey.,1
1695,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,TikTokers have left the chat...,1
1696,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How can anyone hate her after watching the video?,1
1697,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Speaking from the black community, thank you for your courage to speak!!!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3",1
1698,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The best part was at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=5m48s"">5:48</a> when she shows comparative photos. <i>Here&#39;s me eating nachos 10 minutes later...</i>",1
1699,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes it most definitely does  dont believe her lol,1
1700,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think the moral is to always stay in balance with who you want to be and who you should be. Never go straight to one side or you&#39;ll lose yourself and therefore be unhappy.,1
1701,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is the best video Ive ever seen!!,1
1702,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Honestly, being blessed with beauty is one of the worst blessings and this made me realize it. Most people appreciate her looks and not her personality or character and even if she tries to emphasize on them, her appearance seems to just overwrite everything else and that is ABSOLUTELY terrifying. Yes its nice to look good but honestly these days you can even force to become good looking through surgeries and i think its not the best thing to do either. Accept yourself for who you are.<br>Im sure you arent the prettiest but definitely have other traits that make you special :)).<br>And in my opinion beauty is not a very good trait to have as when you get older, you lose it.",1
1703,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,We should not be ashamed because we are pretty. Cmon!,1
1704,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Most females are insecure well into their adulthood say about 40-45,1
1705,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,My maiden sir name is Meisel,1
1706,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks dont matter? That hilarious cause I don&#39;t remember ever seeing a ted talk with 25mil views. I&#39;m sure everyone tuned in because they could see her honesty pointing through her top.,1
1707,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So many negative comments from insecure people. She was right, appearance is only superficial. So unless you&#39;re a psychopath, don&#39;t place all your value on something so superficial such as looks.",1
1708,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Please dont compare your profession to inventors and engineers,1
1709,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ughhhh worst ted talk ever,1
1710,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ex-model.....she NAILED IT.... i&#39;m a mix of Native blood and Greek/Italian and passing as a &quot;white girl&quot; due to anemia has produced some interesting stories for me XD,1

1712,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Having arms and legs isnt everything. Source - I have arms and legs.,1
1713,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I agree with the host by 100%. Don&#39;t judge a book by its cover as for the fact it doesn&#39;t tell everything contained in the book.,1
1714,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,aww,1
1715,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,loved this. &lt;3,1
1716,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"DISCLAIMER: I did enjoy her truth, however it saddens me that in this world there is so much of an emphasis on image. I myself have struggled with my physical appearance for a long time, but something I realized after I began practicing my faith more, is that while mankind may look upon the appearance, thy lord only looks on thy heart. If anyone is not religious that is okay, but it is something to take away. People always get so caught up on the physical, superficial or shallow things but never try and remember what is most important, which is who are you as a person. If everyone were to only look upon a persons character rather than physical attributes, this world would be so immensely beautiful, only if that was our reality.",1
1717,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Gee, I really hope all those superficial people who are smarter than me and more importantly, better at business, people skills and sales because of some unfair genetic dispositions are really insecure and unhappy with themselves. It would make me feel a lot better. I have an idea for you young lady. Give away all your money to poor people, marry some apathetic loser, pop out four kids you can&#39;t afford and go live in affordable housing. Afterward you can give another TED Talk about how you turned your life around. I am curious about your opinion on this. Consider the many outstanding athletes who proud of themselves and make huge fortunes because they are genetically taller, stronger, faster and more dedicated to their training than lesser mortals. Are you going to campaign for them to step down for smaller, slower less able athlete wannabes? How about Bill Gates and the other techno billionaires? Should they profess that they are unworthy and donate all their money to beautiful dumb apologetic supermodels? If you think you have an unfair advantage, get your self some Twinkies and Snickers Bars and go to town. You won&#39;t be a model for very long so you won&#39;t have anything to whine about.",1
1718,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Should be recommended now,1
1719,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks matters. Trust me, I&#39;m ugly.",1
1720,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I was a male model and the world is backwoods for me. I&#39;ve only had one girlfriend, today no friends and I&#39;m usually referred to as a dumb pretty boy douche that&#39;s too soft to work. Maybe attractive women are treated different than attractive males.",1
1721,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The fact that shes a model is exactly why someone WOULDNT believe her saying looks arent everything lol,1
1722,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are everything....one can see the person&#39;s soul by their looks......the only silly thing is people try to hide their ugly  souls through make up , hairstyling,clothes and accessories.........best of luck to those morons",1
1723,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,its just people who made me feel insecure with my face my body and everything . Honestly i didnt care much about my looks until  i was 17 the year i started college. Now im 21 and day by day my insecurities are becoming a daily struggle for me . people always comment on my short height. i know im too short but they dont have to remind me that all the time.. People are so cruel...,1
1724,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,My ex gf cheated on me with two different guys and guess what?<br>Both were good looking than me :/,1

1726,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything says the super model. Does anyone out there have a sense of humor?,1
1727,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"saying looks aren&#39;t everything is like saying money aren&#39;t everything... it is correct, but both are 99.999999% of everything.",1
1728,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hahaha. If you had changed into a woman five inches shorter and 15 pounds larger, you could say something about real life and that&#39;s a joke. In a mini or sweater you are a beautiful woman from the USA, I wonder what your look would look like if you were born in Bangladesh or Kazakhstan.",1
1729,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am going through a tough time in my relationship. I feel that i&#39;m not atractive enough for her, and i can feel that i am right about it. also my other problem is that i am possesive -  honestly, i&#39;m scared of losing someone, getting cheated on.... i love her so much, but i feel that my efforts are not enough... not at all... 2020 is getting worse... june is the worst month for me... i just can&#39;t... it&#39;s so hard!",1
1730,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Shes correct only money matters.,1
1731,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she not cute tho...,1
1732,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It sounds like she doesn&#39;t have a strong sense of identity in who she is or maybe she doesn&#39;t like who she is, she sounds insecure. She&#39;s beautiful but that lack of identity can become unattractive. Moral of the story ladies is love yourselves. An average woman can still be more attractive than an above average beautiful model just by loving yourself and not having identity issues.",1
1733,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,good looks cannot guarantee you will be a good model but can guarantee you will be a model to a large extend,1
1734,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"dude, watch a little longer than first 10 seconds. you&#39;ll like the talk.",1
1735,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,sometimes we all have to understand that no one is perfect and stop judging them by their cover.,1

It might just be my own thinking, but I think modeling has made her even more insecure, only getting judged by her looks, I think that made her very insecure about her selfworth as a person.

1819,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,One thing about TED talks: they put triggering titles.,1
1820,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s wearing designer clothes in this video....,1
1821,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Most people seem to have a harsh feeling towards the models. But the pictures that appear on magazines are mostly designed and decided by professionals who do not have single sense of decency. But the only people who gets blamed are the models, who had no other choice but to either oblige or get kicked out of industry. We tend to notice their indecency of appearing nude publicly but blind to the fact that the directors, photographers and magazine editors are the real culprits who have made modelling a business of making private parts public. Shame on these assholes.<br>She was brave to talk openly about her sacrifices to be a model and also to point out that the models too, have feelings just like rest of us. Kudos.",1
1822,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What the title exactly mean is that.. It&#39;s not surprising or attention worthy if a random person is telling you that &quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything!&quot; but it&#39;s a model herself who is talking on this topic. Its almost like its not a poor man talking about the rights of poor people but a rich man himself who is fighting for rights of poor. That&#39;s how it&#39;s value gets double!!! Hence, this speech was amazing more because this kinda topic is spoken on by a model herself rather than just a random person speaking that looks aren&#39;t everything and stuffs like that!! This was epic and she deserves hats off!! ",1
1823,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,When you have to show cover shoots and personal pics side by side to show who you are is not what you see.,1

1833,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what she is talking about: i get free stuff and not get arrested because of genetic lottery. what the video title is: looks aren&#39;t everything....hmmm.,1
1834,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I feel like it should be a law for every girl to sit through this video before they go and get plastic surgery. Im glad its in everyones recommendation. We need women that represent body positivity for what it really is: loving yourself at your normal, not at your best. Especially nowadays where everyone has the same lips, the same body, the same hair, the same personality. I love how she pointed out that she won the lottery because thats exactly what it is. People need to stop thinking that our body can be molded according to what we see is the current standard of beauty: what will you tell your kids when they turn out looking like you before surgery? Its depressing.",1
1835,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This talk had no point at all. She seems smart and funny so I&#39;m sorry to say this. I don&#39;t feel sympathy for her even though she&#39;s very pleasant and amusing. Perhaps if she had started a programme for kids to downplay beauty it may have worked. Sorry, Cameron, I&#39;m not a hater at all but I think you need to take the story up a level.",1

1849,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The people under this comment section being all negative towards the video are those who Cameron are actually afraid about. The way you talked about this video and her because of her pretty look and her job and not because of the content of her speech. You said good looking people got the chance to talk, but even when she talked, you didn&#39;t listen. You judged this video by the title and not by what the speech was delivering.<br><br>Being hateful and negative doesn&#39;t make you any prettier than you already are and only makes you uglier than you already are.",1

1852,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,None of you seems to understand what she said is that you won&#39;t be happy when you look that way or that way.,1
1853,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good TED talk! So interesting that this talk has been watched over 25 million times (while I write this reply in 2020, 7 years later). If I compare that with other TED talks about different topics  which had less views  it has something to say that so many people are interested in looks. It&#39;s something so obvious and something so sought after that it is really alarming. I think social media (like YouTube, Instagram) add to that for a big part, even from the time there were movies, but essentially it&#39;s something from all centuries. In the ancient Greek world people seek beauty as a way to honor the Gods by making statues of naked men and woman. <br><br>And finally, I&#39;m a model too (just parttime), so yes you get more chances if you are good looking and friendly. But unhappiness is an inside job and trust me, insecurity is a lot more troublesome than looking good on the outside if you can&#39;t be happy with it. Also most people are so superficial thinking that models are just only looks and not people with feelings and brains. It can also be hard because people find it hard to approach you. So in a way you&#39;re kind of isolated. That&#39;s more worse than just being normal. You see, if people  say girls  only come to you because of how good looking you are, but not love you for who you really are, what benefit is that in the end?",1

Only in this case can one become successful.",1
1871,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Its sad that as a beautiful skinny white woman her message is being misinterpreted. But if she was an average looking, older, slightly chubby person of colour her credibility on this topic would instantly be undermined, no one would listen because what do you know? On Ted talks with these normal and standard women, I see comments all the time saying youre never going to get a husband or calling them ugly and fat. So tell me, if youre about to comment negativity, who do you want to listen to? From whom do you want to hear this message of gratitude for inherent legacy and privilege, good looks do not make you happy, and recognizing that success and failure is only part of your efforts and the other part is out of your control?",1

1901,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks doesn&#39;t matter <br>it matters how we see,1
1902,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The only reason models are insecure is because they are next to a bunch of models. If you look like a model but youre in virtually any other line of work, youll probably feel pretty damn secure  especially if youre a woman. Ever notice that in womens tennis, Maria Sharapova makes way more endorsement money than Serena Williams, despite the latter being probably the greatest female tennis player ever?",1
1903,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thank you for revealing the other truth of the fashion industry. These days we treasure health, young, tall, slender, white skin, and femininity, the advertisement images deeply affect every girl. If they cannot reach those standards, they feel bad about themselves. I love the quote &quot;Images are powerful yet superficial&quot;, those images of ideal life are planned by experts and edited. Nowadays we screen lots of pictures daily, in FB or ins... some people are bragging or showing their ideal lifestyle, it helps spread the idea that &quot;THIS is a good life&quot;, however, they never know that the person feels insecure. Therefore, I use less social media, to focus more on MY life and have my own definition. The look is not everything but it does matter, Cameron also points out there are prejudices towards gender and race, it really takes time to overcome it. I recommend teenagers to watch this video, to realize that the truth behind the images and rethink the definition of beauty.",1

1916,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I like how she revealed the facts and led the talk but i think the title should be Looks arent everything but ALMOST EVERYTHING  according to what she said in the last comments ....,1
1917,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks arent everything but looks are important as well like it or not tbh in this world. People say money isnt everything when its important also and looks arent everything when its also important to a extent as well.,1

1923,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Look is not everything - says model , Money isn&#39;t everything - says rich person. I wonder where would she be if it wasn&#39;t for her good look",1

1929,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,the title itself goes extremely deceptive ngl,1
1930,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A lot of thanks for the opportunity,1
1931,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,impressive;  her intelligence is sexy!,1
1932,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Easy for her to say she&#39;s a attractive,1
1933,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,pretty from the inside wont bring you free drinks,1
1934,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The comments in this video are so bitter, like &quot;um yeah, but you&#39;re pretty, so you don&#39;t get to talk&quot;. You, yes, you people right now sitting behind a screen criticising this woman that you don&#39;t even know just cause you&#39;re jealous, what did you do to change your circumstances? &quot;Oh poor me, I&#39;m so ugly&quot;, well, what are you doing to fix that? Are you spending countless hours at the gym? Are you testing different creams in order to fix your skin problems? Are you in a healthy diet? Are you taking care of your hair, nails, outfits, make up, etc? Or are you just expecting life to gift you with godlike beauty without putting effort on it? <br><br>If you were working to better yourself, you wouldn&#39;t be pitting yourself like this. Pathetic.",1

Everyone payed more attention to someone with looks at least once. It&#39;s programmed. She even said that. She&#39;s making us a favor by making people think about how different they treat a &quot;bad-looking&quot; person from a &quot;good-looking&quot; one. She&#39;s bringing down insecure people from the clouds who thinks that they need to be skinny and tall to have more confidence. <br>Start to treat yourself kindly, stop judging your own body and then you&#39;ll see how people can percieve you in other ways.",1
1936,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was so beautiful &lt;3,1
1937,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What a silly title, she&#39;s actually saying that looks ARE everything. That she got everything because of her looks and without any effort. She said it was 50% genetic lottery and 50% legacy, which doesn&#39;t have anything to do with her own doing.",1
1938,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for spreading this message!!,1

1943,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what was the point exactly?,1
1944,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Omg her photo comparisons are real deal and people should be know more about this. Beautiful,1

1949,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Other than recognizing her privilege, she wants people to understand that her profession isn&#39;t as glamorous as it may seem to us, it is exploitative and limiting in the long-run. As she said, after ten years of modelling, it is difficult to pursue a serious career.",1
1950,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She actually  said that you will be treated  good only if you look pretty and will be white,1
1951,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Racist,1
1952,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,is it only me but i think shes racist she keeps saying white,1
1953,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I guess only nd only getting enlightened is everything...,1
1954,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She went there <b>JUST</b> to brag about her beauty. It was just another opportunity to evoke her beautiful features. <br> - Hey Cameron! If you really want to prove the normality of things, just quit modelling. Do not say to us that you are a Model. Get another job, and then you may talk about this subject !!<br><br> You are not someone to be followed, you are not an inspiration, you are not a model for the rest of us. True beauty has its roots in the depths of the human s heart and soul, and of course throughout his actions, deeds for the benefit and welfare of those in need.<br><br>   The most beautiful hands are those which help the most, serving the sick, the lonely and forgotten people.<br><br>When you say ... - Believe me, I&#39;m a model.     actually you want to attract more attention upon yourself.

1955,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nothing is everything. God is.,1
1956,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s so ironic how the people that say that looks dont matter are people that model on the runway. Like millionaires who say money doesn&#39;t matter,1
1957,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This woman is love!!!,1
1958,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not so convincing.,1

1960,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,All insecure women felt so offended by this Ted talk. Beautiful mind makes you more attractive than beautiful face! Have you met very beautiful person who just doesnt attract you just because of the way they behave? That proves that the personality is what makes someone truly beautiful.,1
1961,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;looks aren&#39;t everything &quot;  - a beautiful person  o_O,1
1962,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I need a part 2 because I want to listen to what she has to say.,1
1963,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Only ugly people thinks that good looking people have it all good. But only good looking people understands how looks could hurt and could be a curse to them. You could be bullied or isolated for being ugly, but you could also be bullied and isolated because of your good looks and it&#39;s even more painful that way, because the amount of jealousy and harassment you receive as a good looking person are more than every others. <br><br>Ugly people should stop labelling good looking people get it all, because that claims and expectations hurt even more, as if they were believed to be true but they were proven not to be. <br><br>We&#39;ve seen a lot of good looking people with very average and ugly partners, don&#39;t we? That&#39;s enough to tell how good looks could be disadvantaged",1
1964,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what&#39;s with the negativity in the comments?,1
1965,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I realized the main thing is money ,1
1966,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m 7 ft tall and height isn&#39;t everything,1
1967,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She literally showed pictures of herself to make people realize models are humans too, they&#39;re not perfect at all. Yes it&#39;s so nice to be attractive because you have tones of benefits but let&#39;s not forget that attractive people are most of the times seen as some dolls with amazing features, nobody actually praises them for who they actually are or what they have to say. Why do people hate her lmao?",1
1968,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I am 100% sure only 10% of the people who commented in this video actually finished watching the video or even listen to what she was saying.,1
1969,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If tear drops could be bottled there&#39;d be swimming pools filled by models,1
1970,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Liked your talk -  sense of humour, natural delivery, honesty and intelligence. Cool.",1
1971,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People with looks and money say such things coz people only admire them for their outer beauty or wealth and not for who they are as a person.,1
1972,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Her being honest doesn&#39;t really help here. But then again this isn&#39;t a topic that can be covered within minutes. I never had a boyfriend. I was so ugly as a teen that no guy would look twice and this depressed me. I feel I will go back to being just that when I turn 40. I will be invisible once more. Don&#39;t tell me looks don&#39;t matter.,1
1973,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Says a good looking person. Just like a bilionaire who says that money wont make you happy. Well shall we switch?,1
1974,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,how you look isnt all you are. <br>our soul is so deeper than the face you wear,1
1975,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She should change the title of the speech into What problems you have to face when you are so beautiful. It&#39;s very clearly that what she say doesn&#39;t prove anything about beauty isn&#39;t important and how unlucky people can changing the way everyone looks at them.,1
1976,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m glad that I saw this video. Because right now I feel so down because of my looks. I feel that I&#39;m less of a person. But because of this somehow I  changed my views.,1
1977,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she was very humble. inner beauty with a sense of humor. holla at yah boy,1
1978,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When society finally stops associating beauty with intelligence, work ethic, and our personalities, the world will be a happier place.",1
1979,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People need to start accepting that money isn&#39;t everything / looks aren&#39;t everything. When the general consensus that extremely rich/ attractive people come up with is money/ looks aren&#39;t everything they probably have a point. They actually experienced these things.,1
1980,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I would choose a smart guy with a good sence of humor and confidence over a really hot stupid one, even if he&#39;s rich.",1

1988,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She recognizes her privilege, multiple times throughout the speech so that we don&#39;t forget that she recognizes it. I don&#39;t think any of the negative comments are justified. If anything it proves her point that she cannot be anything more than a pretty face.",1

1999,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love her idea a lot. Actually I thumbed up.But the fact is that beautiful people are happier than ugly people. Due to beautiful people are usually treated better than ugly people. And beautiful people never ever understand how ugly people feel. It is very easy to say looks arent everything for beautiful people. My habit is hiding part of my face. For instance when Im talking to someone, am smiling, and am laying with someone...because I feel so sorry for people who are watching my face. What I think is that I might make them feel uncomfortable because of my ugly face. Looks arent everything? I wish they arent.",1

However, its nice to see how she acknowledges the power of image and how that power has benefitted her, but it is also nice to listen her saying how sad it is to be perceived as a thing or mannequin who can be used and transformed to achieve a goal. I think I can sum up by saying that it is our responsibility to assign the level of power we want  to give to our image over our lives.",1

There&#39;s conventionally ugly people who are mesmerising because of their charisma and charm, and vapid, dull sexy people ALL OVER THE PLACE, and they got to be charismatic or boring because of their upbringing (probably also because of certain genetic predispositions).

Words like &quot;The beauty isn&#39;t everything, just look into your heart...&quot; belongs to the most stupid phrases. It is a lie. Who cares about the heart blablabla?!

No. She even cites her own experiences with getting away with trouble to demonstrate how looks play a very important part in how a person judges you. What she meant to say was that appearance is a superficial part and that it doesnt actually guarantee what most people with image problems think it would guarantee: a better self esteem. Shes stating, when she says models are the most physically insecure people out there, that the looks cant provide you the thing youre actually lacking: a positive outlook on your own self, and that statement can be somewhat relieving and terrifying at the same time, because it means that the problem is not something you can simply change with surgery, diet, makeup or whatever.

2336,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she is such a sweetheart!,1
2337,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=3m23s"">3:23</a>",1
2338,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
2339,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is oblivious of reality and what happens around her. And she laughs at her own jokes, careful boys, hands of her (unless you wanna laugh about her unfunny jokes for the rest of your life.",1
2340,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s kinda easy for someone whos fucking gorgeous to say looks aren&#39;t everything,1
2341,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
2342,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Trust me that your look and appearance isn&#39;t important<br>But I&#39;m a model, of course without my face I can be a person like you",1
2343,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,yeah but its like80%,1
2344,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
2345,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,One of the best models I&#39;ve worked :),1
2346,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<a href=""https://youtu.be/tFslS6oBOKQ"">https://youtu.be/tFslS6oBOKQ</a><br>Best place to visit in Japan.",1
2347,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She even had 20+ million views compared to other ted talks like the issue in north korea just because she&#39;s pretty and a model. but hey I admire her honesty and intentions - kudos to you!,1
2348,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This conversation again.,1
2349,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
2350,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Einstein didn&#39;t have the look, but he got the brain, and that made him decipher the Universe.",1
2351,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Shes actually pretty funny and I feel like people dont think about that cuz people done necessarily associate pretty with funny but just an observation lol,1
2352,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Having an advantage and saying it isnt everything conveys the message that just because you have something good doesnt mean your problems go away. I used to think that if I were a tall man, strangers would stop being dismissive and condescending towards me. Then I had a boyfriend who is 63 and watched him be treated with even more dismissiveness and condescension from strangers than I had. I value what privileged people say about about having that privilege because they can tell you what life is like when you get what you dont have. It may sound like being attractive and rich would make your life so easy, but it also brings its own problems such as people dismissing the hard work you put into your achievements on being rich or good looking.",1
2353,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I wanted to be a model, I mean like a her. but I knew to beautiful woman is hard. I wanna think what is important for me. Thanks!",1
2354,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I hate when beautiful people say that &quot;look isn&#39;t everything.&quot; When they really don&#39;t have a clue, how every situation in life is so much harder if you are less beautiful!",1
2355,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
2356,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks arent everything. Value is everything.,1
2357,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How you look is part of who you rare. At least &#39;part&#39;.,1
2358,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks arent everything but it is important. So let me give my opinion on this. For example two guys went for an interview, both with the same degree, both had good grades with equally great communication skills, however one had good physiques, better heights, smells better and u get my point. The other is chubbier, shorter, didnt smells so great, so overall the first one is like better looking than the other. Tell me, logically who you wouldve choose, of course the first one because they had the better advantage on attracting clients, you get my point? Of course looks arent everything but it is important, IMPRESSION are important, take care of yourself, take care of your looks",1
2359,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,         <br>              ,1

2361,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Next on ted :Marriage isn&#39;t everything - henry VIII,1
2362,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,very very nice tedtalk,1
2363,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,people judge u and class u according to how u look.,1
2364,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s thinking too hard! She&#39;s gonna hurt herself!,1
2365,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautifully explained,1
2366,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,HUMANS SUCK..IN GENERAL.. THATS WHY I HAVE A BERY SPECIAL CONECTION WITH ANIMALS..,1
2367,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,There is differnce between <b>&quot;looks are not everything&quot;</b> and <b>&quot;looks doesn&#39;t matter&quot;</b>,1
2368,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t  everything says one of the most beautiful person in the world,1
2369,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
2370,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I like how she is aware of her privilege, and also that she brought up racial injustice.  Not just a pretty face.  Thoughtful.  What she said about models being very insecure is true.",1
2371,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what gets on my nerves is beautiful people telling us to love our imperfections - that makes me feel worse and as if im the only one that has to care when really everybody else is judging you,1
2372,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Fair dues for getting up there but lets be realistic here , you look like her and have money your life is going to be a ton easier than some fat girl with bad acne , a face like a smacked shovel and no money (or bloke for that matter ) . In the west looks (for women particularly ) is everything , when have you ever seen (as a generalization) a girl that looks like Gal Gadot or scarlet Johansson struggling to get a job or find a mate with resources ? She sounds like she has a lot of guilt she is carrying around and thats admirable that she recognizes her privileged looks but dont be deluded she would swop any of that to just be a plain jane with over sized hips and saggy boobs . For men competing in this world looks are also  important , yah think Brad Pitt would be a multi millionaire at 30 if he looked like me , hes not exactly al Pacino in the acting stakes , he got his break and millions purely on his looks and maybe a bit of acting skill but no better than thousands of other wannabes . Men do have it easier though I would say because if they bust their balls and get to be the best at what they do in business anyway they can make it . Women have it much tougher , if you look like the back end of a bus and try being the ceo if a Fortune 500 your gonna struggle a long time .  The plain fact is humans will respond favorably to attractive people , make the road a little smoother if you like , its hard wired into our DNA and biology . Thats not to say attractive people have more value than ordinary people but in terms of lifes hardships they have a huge advantage over the rest of us .",1
2373,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I like her for her beauty.,1
2374,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lol I&#39;m average pretty and still hate myself! I hate my flat face, my crooked nose, hooded lazy eyes, under eye bags, lack of check, uneven jaw, no boobs, no but, skinny, thin balding hair. God life sucks hahaha",1

2376,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,<br>,1
2377,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,don&#39;t sympathize others yet. life is a struggle. Your difficult time hasn&#39;t come yet,1
2378,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>,1
2379,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I not even gon watch this bullshit because imma tell you RIGHT NOW.... LOOKS ARE EVERYTHING.... this bih cappin,1
2380,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great talk, inspiring, well done, you did great &amp; showed us a very rare insight into the dark world of the high stakes fashion industry.. <br>",1
2381,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bo yapm,1
2382,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes i used to see you feshon tv,1
2383,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y," .   ,  ,  .",1
2384,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for your honesty. Most people can&#39;t handle the truth,1
2385,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks matters...ugly one would have experienced.( That&#39;s me),1
2386,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wouldnt mind looking like her.,1
2387,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;A imagem  poderosa, mas a imagem tambm  superficial&quot;.",1
2388,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am distraught by the amount of insecure, bitter, and lazy people in the comments that are turning her talk into a joke. I have never experienced &quot;if you are prettier, you have a better chance&quot;. People that look pretty are people who work hard to make the best out of life, and take care of themselves and others around them. I know a lot of pretty people, (yes, their appearance too). There are also girls I know that are &quot;superficial pretty&quot; that don&#39;t even stand a chance in finding a nice job or modelling either. Of course, it&#39;s easy now because of instagram but you can only be young for X amount of time. In every way, Cameron is right. Don&#39;t get upset that rich people, and models know the grey areas! You are so lucky that some of them decide to share their experience and insight with you.",1
2389,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The point is that she depends on her looks for everything: her job and her relationships with people. It must be devastating to feel like nobody&#39;s interested in anything but her appearance although she probably has much more to offer. She mentioned briefly that she never had a boyfriend and implied that women don&#39;t like her. I guess that having male friends who don&#39;t secretly have sexual interest in you are also hard to find. With that said you could really see how &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot;. Beauty fades as well,1
2390,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,TED talks for twelve year olds.,1
2391,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I watched to see if you would be genuine &amp; sincere.    Yes I do believe you have met my two requirements.  Life is funny, no matter what social caliber one might achieve or fall into it boils down to issues at the top are similar to those at the bottom. Grass is greener fits all around",1
2392,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oh boohoo, it sucks being pretty because I feel insecure. My god, is that even a real problem?! She will never experience what it&#39;s like being on the other side. Oh guess what? She got invited to TED just because of her looks too!",1
2393,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"U still talk superficially, there was no true point, it was just all still about u.",1
2394,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Was she extolling the virtues of the hijab!?<br><br>P.S. - I didn&#39;t mean the face covering.,1
2395,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Reality bites and thats the truth! I admire her for being honest that shes privileged of what she had accomplished for how she looks. Its like living in a place that has almost perfect weather 365 days a year vs. places that are extremely cold or hot and humid. Tho the latter can be potentially fix but you know what I mean :),1
2396,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Was I the only one that thought she was just as sexy with the second outfit?  She is getting nowhere with her guilt.,1
2397,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Why do you guys want money so bad? Having money isn&#39;t a big deal. Take it from me, a guy who was born with a hundred billion dollars.&quot;",1
2398,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,   ?  ?,1
2399,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i think a beautiful person can tell us about beauty what he feel becouse he have .how can a ugly person tell about  feeling of beauty when he does not have,1
2400,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Came here to see the TED comments.,1
2401,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Believe me, money isnt everything - Warren Buffet",1
2402,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are everything...<br><br>That&#39;s why you all are watching this video.  <br><br>Are you people that stupid..,1
2403,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=6m59s"">6:59</a> the point",1
2404,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People will stay around you either because you&#39;re beatiful or because you are sucessfull in what you do.,1
2405,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One of the TED videos thhat I clicked dislike. Why? Because many girls look like a model and even try to follow this path, but the factor that decide if the girl STAY on thhis pat and become a model, does not depend on the appereance. It is strictly connected with te character and perseverance. And the reward is awesome - young woman can visit many countries, meet many people, and this can really help her to become a successful person, mailny inside. I know may girls with very beauty faces and figure, which are not models, because they think, that appearence is everything...the are wrong.",1
2406,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But looks have clear advantage over <a href=""http://things.my/"">things.My</a> opinion only.",1
2407,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,When I was researching this talk I asked my publist will I be a moron and yes yes I am,1
2408,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks may not be everything but health is something. It helps to be healthy and active.,1
2409,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I can appreciate what it took for her to process these feelings and then face going public with sharing.  It would be just awesome if her next step in growth is to step outside of the model world and move on with her education and contribute in another way.  She is clearly intelligent, and this would really help bring her message full circle.",1
2410,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cmon guys! Looks arent everything! They are only about 90% of everything, its a big difference",1
2411,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So she didn&#39;t had her period at 16 years old?? Typical retarted tall woman,1
2412,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So what&#39;s your point? You just sound like another Self Loathing Liberal, how many of those &quot;black and Latino&quot; men that were stopped and frisked were wearing slacks and a collared shirt? None, Stop and Frisk was one of the most successful crime deterrents ever, it got thousands of illegal guns off the street. The crime rate plummeted.",1
2413,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Having no arms or legs isnt everything..............said the octopus!,1
2414,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,No offense to her nor TED talks but I still do not get what the big message here was,1
2415,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So dumb.,1
2416,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What a great talk. Thanks, Cameron.",1
2417,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"God bless you <a href=""https://youtu.be/E5igxAyX0sc"">https://youtu.be/E5igxAyX0sc</a>",1
2418,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Someone smash her face so she is disfigured.,1
2419,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,$300k/yr news anchors must be slender and pretty.  Fatsos dont get those jobs,1
2420,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But height is everything,1
2421,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Flesh and skin clothe us skeletons. PRAISE OUR LORD and Creator.,1
2422,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Powerful!,1
2423,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<a href=""https://youtu.be/f1cx04DjvN4"">https://youtu.be/f1cx04DjvN4</a>",1
2424,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"you know, I started watching this with every intention of being snarky but honestly....I think she was truthful and made some valid points I hadn&#39;t expected. Yes she&#39;s beautiful and working in a glamorous industry but even that wasn&#39;t enough since they photoshop and engineer everything to make her even more so. She spoke to the illusion of modeling, and I think a lot of people forget that it is, in fact, an business based on illusion.",1
2425,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I get what she&#39;s saying. Everyone thinks she&#39;s a goddess and cannot have any problems with confidence or cannot be unhappy but is actually not the case. Likewise to people who has money. <br>Sometimes, I feel scared by the thought of &quot;what if I indeed have everything, looks, money, perfect relationship and all that but I still feel empty or unhappy?&quot; That&#39;s why even if there are super successful people out there, they can still be unhappy or be depressed. <br>There were lots of things that we think we need in life just because we can see others are greatly benefitting from them but we haven&#39;t considered that they are just humans too and one way or another, they have problems on their own that we don&#39;t know.",1
2426,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Of those 23 875 944 views, how many do you think clicked on the video because she is so beautiful? I know I did. What about you? P.S. Great speech!!",1

2428,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is honest and presented it powerfully,1
2429,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"As a tan skinned girl who lives in asia (which have a fair white skin as their beauty standard) i knew very well that looks matters. Honestly, i got rejected from some jobs only bcs my skin.",1
2430,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,At least she gets well paid job. I apply over 100 jobs to get couple of interviews. :(,1
2431,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I would like to get to know her better,1
2432,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,NEWS FLASH: LIFE ISN&#39;T FAIR. There&#39;s no need to apologize for the unique blessings you&#39;re given. Use them for all that they&#39;re worth. And use your overflow to bless others.,1
2433,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes,  been good looking gets you free stuff but many are very stupid so is specially valuable to be smart and charismatic like her, is special!  Cause is very rare! <br>The real lucky ones are people like Drake, some talent but massively overrated in this Day and age!",1
2434,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If she hated being a model then she should just stop and give up lol <br>Not tell other people that it&#39;s fake Bec it&#39;s not,1
2435,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Your life must be so hard,1
2436,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She did a amazing speech. Looks or money doesn&#39;t make you happy, that was one of her points. The comments in this video distort her ideas.",1
2437,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Money isnt everything&quot;, Bill Gates",1
2438,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not being able to eat whatever you want, constantly bothered about your look, after a certain age there is no guarantee of more work, being treated as show pieces.. That&#39;s what a model also hard to go through!!",1
2439,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hahahahahaha Ted talks the pseudo woke committee,1
2440,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a model.<br>Ugly me: What??!",1
2441,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Amazing, it does wake me up.",1
2442,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow!beautiful and brilliant. Incredibly rare trait.,1
2443,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A lot of models are the most insecure people in earth. I cant feel it. All I see is confidence and arty by them,1
2444,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She left out the transexual requirement switched at birth part of a rich satanic family,1
2445,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She just sounds guilty that shes so pretty and has it &quot;better&quot; than &quot;ugly&quot; people and then tries to make &quot;ugly&quot; people feel better by saying that its not everything its cracked up to be just because pretty people have it hard too because they are so &quot;insecure&quot;.<br>everything has its positives and its negatives and unfortunately, no one wants to hear a pretty person complain about being pretty or condescended to and made to feel victimized by being ugly<br>shes pretty and needs to not feel bad about it",1
2446,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,5 seconds in and idk what was wrong with her dress it looked fine,1
2447,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are NOT everything for it is only one part of a person. There are several other factors that make a person who they are individually. The word is complex. HOWEVER while looks may not be everything, it is HANDS DOWN one of the most important aspects to ones life. GOD did not enfore this, society did, so we should correct our mistake. ",1
2448,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,True strength of character when you are as honest as this. Never feel guilty about being beautiful. It is a gift,1
2449,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;ll forever remember your name Cameron Russell. You got a new fan on me!,1
2450,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I can see how the main message can get a little lost here. But I think ultimately what she&#39;s saying is this: yes, the harsh reality is that you are given a lot more things and opportunities when you are beautiful. But in spite of everything you receive for your looks, you can still be really insecure and unhappy. Therefore, looks aren&#39;t everything.",1
2451,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s obvious that the person who is a science student can only be the one to say the inside and true feeling and hardships of being one .THUS ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING THAT WHY DO ALL BEAUTIFUL AND RICH PEOPLE COMMENT ON MONEY AND LOOKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED IT AND KNOW THE THING IT LACKS AND IS BENEFITIAL,1
2452,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Today I happed to sat near a girl(Without any intention) in the cafe, she suddenly wakes up and<br>got the other place.<br>I could never forget her face, and I don&#39;t want to see her again.",1
2453,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"THEY ONLY LOOK AT HER LIKE PIECE OF MEAT , SHES STRONG WOMAN !",1
2454,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why feeling guilty for being hot ?,1
2455,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She either too irresponsibe or too confidence in herself. A pretty chick like her always surrounded with first class treatment do not know she can make more money or better treat than any less fortunate people.,1
2456,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I still would prefer to look like her.. shallow? Maybe.. she is stunning naturally...,1
2457,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good looks are more crucial to women&#39;s lives. Men have other tools to survive well. A non-attractive woman have difficulties in finding adecenthusband and a decent job. Unfortunately this world belongs to men and men are very judgemental on women looks.,1
2458,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You should never feel guilty for what you were born with ! F<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ck"">#ck</a> those who would try to make you feel like that.",1
2459,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lots of people in the comments have an inferiority complex, honestly if you are so lacking of confidence and are only jealous of others then no wonder things arent going well for you even if you are drop dead gorgeous ( models usually arent btw )",1
2460,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s right, looks aren&#39;t everything.  She&#39;s was also born to wealth.  To a well connected mother listed as one of Time&#39;s 100 Most Influential People.   <br><br>Rich, white, gorgeous, influential and connected.  She hit the birth lottery in at least five ways.<br><br>I doubt she ever had a clue how average people even live.",1
2461,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fun Fact :<br>Almost every person commented below and even you may agree looks aren&#39;t everything but won&#39;t go out without looking in a mirror !!,1
2462,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,23 million viewers on your video I would say look is everything.,1
2463,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i feel like 70% of the comments didn&#39;t even try to hear her out. She made some really striking points.,1
2464,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really loved your ted talk wow!!! So inspirational,1
2465,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Winning the genetic lottery is nothing to apologize for. I detest this concept of &#39;privilege&#39;. She is tall with bone structure that fits a western aesthetic. So what? In fashion, the clothing/fabric needs to drape a certain way. Sometimes it won&#39;t drape the way the creator wants on a wider frame. Her body fits the need, AND she is able to move in a way that is required in that field. Period. The solution isn&#39;t to force the designers to use short, wider models. No solution is needed. This is simply inducing guilt in women. How dare you be attractive! It is bogus. You won the genetic lottery. Enjoy it because it fades with time. Basketball players don&#39;t apologize for being tall and wring their hands over privilege. They too, won the genetic lottery and they too are able to move in a way that fulfills the need of their field. Are we forcing the NBA to accept players who are 5&#39; 6&quot; and uncoordinated? Sounds very funny? It is. If men don&#39;t have to apologize for their genetic win why do women?",1
2466,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder ,not everybody likes their tea the same  my grandfather said as long as you smell nice and dress nice someone one out there will like you ",1
2467,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"My experience in 54 years has been high beauty means high maintenance, not just make up and whatever, but telling them often how beautiful theyre. Most of the time very shallow and self centered. I was a male model when I was young, my girlfriends were always average, because they were real and funny. Beauty is only skin deep. Money is a commodity to be traded not worshiped. Be happy with who you are and pursue your passions, you will be way happier",1
2468,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,hey ted it would be better if you add subtitle.,1
2469,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks and confidence are different thing... ,1
2470,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Money isn&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a billionaire.&quot;",1
2471,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She looks marvelous. She may not feel marvelous. But she LOOKS marvelous. And, it is ALWAYS better too look good than to feel good.",1
2472,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not at all  it&#39;s about the little things and what&#39;s on the inside, deep down is what matters .",1
2473,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Easy for you to say...you got looks and you  are a successful model...if you were a ugly person...I&#39;d love to hear you out...,1
2474,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wonderful Speach,1
2475,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,All you people did not get her point...,1
2476,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Pretty people always say that , looks are nothing and everyone is beautiful ... bla bla , but reality is beauty is treated as power , and if you are not privileged with that power you are going to face many problems ....",1
2477,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why do you have make it racial? disgusting...,1
2478,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything, unless you look bad.",1
2479,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Very true, looks aren&#39;t everything, but it sure would be most compelling to hear from someone who had street cred. on both sides of the situation...with ugly first and beauty after! I&#39;m one of those &#39;less attractive&#39; people (broad shoulders, small breasts, flat butt, no waist, apple shaped belly in case you&#39;re doubting!) and there is a huge difference in how I&#39;m treated when I&#39;m having a &#39;more attractive&#39; body/looks day/week/month/year/decade versus a &#39;less attractive&#39; time. My mood and level of connection makes a difference in how people treat me also, so I have dated, had multiple people I liked or loved who were interested in me, and who wanted to marry me.  In fact I counsel people on how to bring out their most attractive and convey it in mood, attitude and energy or connection, so I believe strongly that looks are not everything, but looks ARE also a big factor...no question. Saying otherwise to someone less culturally or biologically attractive is a  little like telling a dyslexic that reading won&#39;t get in the way...",1
2480,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything and yet I am going to give a talk showing my beautiful and sexy legs hoping you&#39;ll will concentrate on my   &quot; looks  aren&#39;t everything &quot; rhetoric. <br> Sighhhh,1
2481,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think she just proved that look is<br> everything.,1
2482,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I was expecting more talk, feels like it ended abruptly.",1
2483,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Looks are not everything.&quot; <br><br>Proceeds to tell us about how a career and fame came to you JUST for being the way you look. Ok..,1
2484,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yea, right! Obviously looks are (not) everything - until you lose your looks and have to get by without them like normal people do. Hearing a beautiful person talk about the down side of being beautiful is like hearing a rich person complaining about the downside of having too much money. Obviously the benefits of being rich outweigh any and all  inherent disadvantages, otherwise the rich people would give away all of their money and live as pauper monks (or nuns). How many rich people actually do that? Not many. Likewise, if being beautiful was really such a burden, then all of the pretty people would let themselves go, gain weight, let their hair and hygiene go wild, quit buying make-up and expensive clothes, and just become plain and ugly like the rest of us. Do any of the beautiful people actually do that? Maybe for a day when they cover up with a hat and sunglasses to disguise themselves so that they can go shopping in peace, but no one deliberately tries to permanent disfigure their appearance because they cannot stand all of the unearned, positive attention that they are getting anymore because of their pretty face, and just become a regular slob like the rest of us plain looking peasants. Actions speak louder than words. I dont believe anything that she is saying about how hard it is to be born with the privilege of being attractive. Image is power. Pretty people dont realize how much power that they have until they lose it. Should society value looks as much as we obviously do? Probably not, but there is no denying that society is the way that it is.",1
2485,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;ve been pulled over by cops quite a few times but never got a ticket.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m attractive but I have a baby face and of course I&#39;m white.  That has gotten me quite a few things in life.  So if anyone says looks aren&#39;t everything they are wrong.,1
2486,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thicc thighs are better.,1
2487,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why is she breathing so hard?????,1
2488,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She also graduated from Columbia University. Sure, looks isnt everything. Intelligence plays a role too!",1
2489,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s not everything, but it sure helps a person get through life.  But people are so much more than looks, that much is true.  However, sadly, people often do judge a book by it&#39;s cover.",1
2490,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I was just thinking about my insecurities on my legs..,1
2491,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Okay, most of the biggest modeling agencies and magazine companies are from countries in which people are mostly white, and aimed at consumers from countries that are also mostly white, so why would it suprise you that models are mostly white? I&#39;m sure if I go to Kenia, most of the female natives will not find me as attractive as black, muscular men, and that&#39;s fine, but in those countries people can&#39;t afford a five thousand dollar pair of shoes, so they are not the target demographic for these big companies, and that&#39;s also fine.",1
2492,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fun fact: Looks also aren&#39;t entirely genetic,1
2493,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Me looks is every thing believe me i am ugly,1
2494,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I liked this post , Not because of whom she is but by what she said , Good luck in the future.",1
2495,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are right. Looks don&#39;t matter. Do you want to hang out sometime. I&#39;ll pay for everything,1
2496,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love her realness and her truth in everything she said. She was so nervous you could hear it in her voice. I once wanted to be a model too but I was also insecure.. and the need or want of being a model dropped as I became more confident within myself.,1
2497,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Limbs aren&#39;t everything. Believe me, I have all 4 of them.",1
2498,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Talks like these are the reason I stopped caring about TED talks.,1
2499,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Reminds me of a Kanye lyric - having moneys not everything, not having it is",1
2500,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,New rule! Watch the video before you comment! 70% of the comment section could have been spared that way.,1
2501,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,if teardrops could be bottled~,1
2502,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ugh no you had good tongue posture and eat food correctly and kept your mouth close and everything else Dr. mike New has proven correct about beauty,1
2503,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s attributing motive to a statistic. I think  can agree with her on the problems, but not the causation of the problem.",1
2504,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,l apparence ne fait pas tout elle fait la globalit,1
2505,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No. The loudest point she made is that it is NOT me.<br>They are rewarded for not being who they are. And the reason that many models ARE insecure is that inherent in  their jobs, they must daily focus on every degree of physical beauty in exhausting repetition. <br>And they are paid to NOT reflect their identity. Rather they are constantly reminded its who they are NOT,<br>that is rewarded, the false self. Liked for something that is foreign inauthentic self. Its something like the gender dys -phoria struggle only worse because no one feels the least bit empathetic toward THAT struggle.",1
2506,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why is she a white model instead just a &quot;Model&quot;.,1
2507,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i dont get why everyone is tearing her down she was literally saying pictures are fake. they&#39;re just ideas put together by a group of professionals. they had her doing these sexualized shoots and she was a child who was just being instructed because she&#39;s conventionally attractive. and even though she&#39;s a runway model who people aspire to be shes heavily insecure because her looks are what her job is!,1
2508,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Your genetics are everything you got,1
2509,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,HAHAHAHAHA,1
2510,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i have a medical condition that severely disfigured me for years and when i finally managed it i was shocked at how differently i was treated... I&#39;m not blaming society it&#39;s just how it is,1
2511,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Loved this. Thank you.,1
2512,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Schn das du so ehrlich bist. mach bitte weiter hat mir und denk ich vielen mnschen die augen geffnet dank &lt;3,1
2513,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything, says a beautiful person.<br>Money isn&#39;t everything, says a wealthy person.",1
2514,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Be greatful for the moment you are living. Don&#39;t compare.,1
2515,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks might not be everything....only if you have solutions for everyone&#39;s question..else find your place,1
2516,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well ,  she is beautiful and intelligent and well spoken..  and I am sure rich.....  she did win lifes lottery",1
2517,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Poor little girl... <br>&quot;There is less black models. &quot;  And why exactly is that racist?,1
2518,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I feel like her jokes were very unappreciated, shes got a good sense of humor and you could tell she was nervous to be there",1
2519,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This took a lot of guts. Great job!,1
2520,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She said it - we are programmed for this. Every species where there is a competition for procreation is programmed for this. I agree the ideals are worth pursuing, but they are also unachievable. They go against the very nature of our existence. We choose what we like. What we like is defined by our senses. And the most important sense we have is vision. No way around it.",1
2521,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Person who has no experience of looking bad tells bad looking people her opinions.,1
2522,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Bullshit!! Only pretty people say &quot;looks is not everything&quot;, only rich people say money is not everything! First u have go there and see for yourself to know and believe that it really is so",1
2523,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So the conclusion is......no one is happy,1
2524,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are everything, believe me, im ugly",1
2525,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,All I hear is hypocrisy. <br>Looks matter the most. Noone cares about unattractive people. <br>Unattractive people have to work much harder to prove themselves.<br><br>People start noticing unattractive people only after they become successful.<br><br>People say Money can&#39;t buy happiness. But noone knows what poverty can buy besides despair.,1
2526,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a lovely woman,1
2527,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I also hit the beautiful looks lottery. Beautiful hair,face,teeth,body and white skin. Did it make a difference? Absolutely,so much attention from men of all ages, people treat me well in public. What it did the most for me is u didn&#39;t worry that much how I look. Very little effort,didnt have to have great clothes, wear light make up, and do very little to my hair and its beautiful and shiny. So it gave me a break from what most people worry about",1
2528,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,   -  .    -   .,1
2529,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Humility goes up and you did great,1
2530,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just do wathever you want, follow your hearth, take the risk",1
2531,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So what is everything? Kinda stupid question.,1
2532,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So what was the point?,1
2533,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is an idiot,1
2534,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I have my doubts about her modesty. Excuse me. And yes sceptical.,1
2535,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Personality can be faked but looks? I think not so. It play a big game in our life.,1
2536,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People wants to see what they can not see every day ,,  that is why they take pictures of Exotic cars, buildings, Animals.. Just enjoy your job and dont go too deep into it.  You dont have to cure cancer to feel fulfilled and happy.   And Race should not be brought into this.  Most NBA players are Black ,, and?   Its performance based,, its what market demands , its called capitalism.  This is is WHY TRUMP is winning because of this non sense agendas.   over 50% of NYPD are non white and yet they  do these  &quot;racist&quot; things.   Statements like that create Victim mentality.  Yes some cultures developed the &quot;reputation&quot; and unfortunately many innocent straight up young people have to deal with the consequence.  Work on your community,, change the pattern.  How come Asian community doesn&#39;t have same problem.  Not justifying any racism and I know there are cases like that but the this problem that have many heads and racism is just one of them.  That is the real truth that NOBODY want to talk about for fear of being &quot;racist&quot;.   This speech is just another &quot;tell them what the want to hear&quot; .. its not the real truth.",1

2543,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,rule of thumb is to find someone better looking than you,1
2544,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Her point is right. We should appreciate the fact that a model is speaking truth about the industry. The pictures that we see and compare ourselves to are actually not real. She&#39;s talking about her privilege that she has due to her beauty and she doesn&#39;t likes that because why do other people suffer just because of their looks.,1
2545,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Funny thing that she is actually saying &#39;looks are everything&#39; and she doesnt like it. I am enlightened honey, thank you.",1

2561,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I liked the girl, she was kindly but speech was not making any sense :/ But I think people who trapped with their looks are resigned powerless cowards. Sorry if Im rude . Cuz yeah image can be changed so easily and I admit better looks mean more privilege but it does not mean we cant handle, what important is charisma and showing who you are with your look",1

2565,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron, I enjoyed your tedtalk. Hearing you, coming to terms and then explaining how you have personally  benefited from white privilege was moving. Also, to see you, a woman with your kind of platform talking about this delicate subject was awesome.  You have an open mind.",1

Ungrateful, angry and resentful. The problem with these types of people is that they will never be happy. Weather they have a everything or nothing at all. The attitude will be the same. Ungrateful, angry and resentful. Ending with shame and guilt based upon a misguided perspective on life. <br><br>You can see these types in the comment section as well. Peace will always be fleeting and you will find no rest. Jesus can only save you.",1

2578,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks arent everything. But its easy for her to say as shes beautiful and thus her life is easier and she makes money by literally just being pretty. They arent everything but your life and place in society is better as a result.,1

2586,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,WTF? That depends on the knowledge and character of the individual. Looks can mean nothing to some and impressionable to others.,1
2587,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You can get banefits in starting with ur good Looks..<br>But after sometimes.<br>If u will not treat people right.<br>You will loose Good People around you..<br>And you will be sorunded by Only bad people..<br>N those people will Use you by giving some Benefits..,1

2589,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"MyFestivus true. i wont ever say im the prettiest person i know but i know so that looking a certain way really does give us benifits. people are nicer especially men. when i borrow a little thing they go quite about out of their way for me. when i forget my money i can just ask people for a little sum and they trust me already. now, im happy with these benifits but that doesnt really make me who i am. i think above all my personality sticks out. ive noticed that when i talk to someone and they seem to be pure and honest about themselves i think very little about the way the look. so what we should learn here is that, looks doesnt really matter as much as how you treat people especially yourself. honesty always wins.",1

Yes looks make life easier, yes money can make life easier, yes good education or social backgrounds easier...but just because youre privileged doesnt mean u cant address such issues and have your opinions on them...because privileged or not privileged the society just wants to stay rigid and judge people",1

2643,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The consensus seems to be by majority of the comments that looks are very important. It isn&#39;t at all. Some are physically beautiful and yet haven&#39;t got any intelligence. Many cannot speak proper, or carry a conversation. I was born beautiful and the only thing my parents wanted and cared about is my brain and that I use it. In my 20&#39;s Judge Judy wrote a book called Beauty Fades Dumb is Forever. My looks didn&#39;t get me into my career, my brain did. My husband thought &amp; thinks I&#39;m beautiful, he didn&#39;t marry me for looks, he married me for my brain. My intelligence opened my doors for me, being beautiful did not. My opinion anyway, I&#39;ll choose reading a book with my time any day over putting makeup on or getting nails put on that I grow myself and polish with simple clear coat. Bottom line is when you reach my age you don&#39;t care how beautiful someone is on the outside. It&#39;s truly what is in one&#39;s heart that matters.",1

And while 70k is a lot those are not the people I would call rich yet. I&#39;m sure this works the same for looks. If you look like an average healthy person you benefit from that.

I guess that is why people who want in another person for themselves what they can&#39;t have find it difficult to relate or empathize with them.

2688,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"While I&#39;m not ugly, I&#39;m far from being model like, but I&#39;ve had friends who have been really stunning, and where I&#39;ve gone out with them, you wouldn&#39;t believe the attention they get. It&#39;s as if they&#39;re famous. Meanwhile, I&#39;m invisible. And it is hard to see that, to live that, when you do have friends who look like models, to see how much better they get treated than you. How they get attention from the good looking guys, when those guys don&#39;t notice you. How counter staff treat them like VIPs, how everyone smiles at them. How everything comes easy to them. Most people who look that good never have to worry about money. They don&#39;t have to work some s**t job where they get treated badly. The list is endless. And I have no idea what point she was trying to make, apart from confirming that in fact, looks make a huge difference.",1
2689,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I have seen a statistic suggesting, if you are being re-introduced into society or being released from a mental institution, the more pretty you were, especially women, the more likely you would succeed.",1

2691,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lookers have lots of issues that uglies don&#39;t have to deal with. This is a PC speech and I had to roll up my pants legs. But she&#39;s not bad to look at.,1
2692,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,WHAT A HYPOCRIT...,1
2693,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I thought this talk was already pointless enough (models are probably the most insecure people in the world, therefore being good-looking doesn&#39;t make you happy! nope that&#39;s a false equivalency, models are insecure because their looks is their only employable trait, your average pretty law student isn&#39;t going to spend all day worrying about a pimple or starve herself so her premise is already wrong) but now I&#39;ve found out that she&#39;s also the daughter of a very successful woman Robin Chase and she wasn&#39;t scouted, she became a model because her mother&#39;s friend worked at her first modeling agency. So we get this woman who didn&#39;t just win the genetic lottery but pretty much got handed everything on a silver platter talking about...... lookism is bad? models are insecure? and? so what? and people applaud her for what? oh you are so brave to talk about these topics? that everyone already knows anyway? and saying platitudes like &quot;image is artificial&quot;? Damn. I&#39;m just disappointed in the quality of TED.",1
2694,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are right they are not everything they are almost everything I know because I am a very ugly person and I face discrimination,1
2695,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,most of the ppl in these comments didn&#39;t watch the video/missed the point lol,1
2696,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The way you look has an emotional impact on people even subconsciously without trying, many guys will tell you, when they are around beautiful women they tend to short circuit and get anxious!!! And when around not so pretty girls, just dandy!",1

2698,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"True attractiveness for both men and women actually has very little to do with being &quot;good looking.&quot; Plenty of people are superficially &quot;attractive&quot; yet remain so emotionally and psychologically immature their whole lives, they never understand what it is to BE a truly attractive person - someone people want to be around and find pleasure in feeling drawn to deeper aspects of them beyond mere sexual attraction. All these poor souls ever attract is other people who are superficially attractive and just as spiritually poor as themselves.",1

2706,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So many people are missing the point or didn&#39;t even watch the video. She is admitting that she is a pretty, white, privileged woman. She is also saying that it&#39;s wrong for society to place so much importance on physical looks. There are downfalls to being beautiful. It&#39;s true that being beautiful and or rich makes life easier. It doesn&#39;t however grant you happiness or a perfect life.",1

2709,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s making a false equivalency with models=good-looking people. not every good-looking person is insecure lol. it makes sense for a career model to be insecure since their looks is their only employable asset.,1
2710,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"it actually makes sense to me that she says models are probably the most insecure people on the planet. I mean I don&#39;t personally believe it given all those people born with deformities and personally I&#39;ve been bullied for being ugly and spent years hating myself but whatever, for the sake of argument, it makes sense that models are probably quite insecure compared to say good-looking non-models (if that&#39;s actually true) because if my looks were my only employable &quot;skill&quot; I&#39;d be damn neurotic to make sure I look perfect all the time so I can get work. I don&#39;t feel sorry for them though. no one forced them to not develop other employable skills. she&#39;s making a false equivalency with models=good-looking people. not every good-looking person is insecure lol, your average pretty medical student isn&#39;t spending all day feeling insecure about her face.",1
2711,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This comment section stupid. Y&#39;all hate on her because of her good genetics and disregard the point she way trying to make, some people really can&#39;t be helped.",1

2713,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She says she won the genetic lottery.  How shallow!  Let others decide if u won the genetic lottery.  Not u!  The one thing and I believe the one thing that u really have pretty much is height.  Thats almost pretty much it.  U have to hit their height standards and then u have to keep yourself thin enough to fit in their weight category.  U dont have to be beautiful facially, have amazing hair because the experts will work around that.",1
2714,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love it; shes honest.,1
2715,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How many of you can say &quot;I really like myself&quot; or &quot;I really love myself&quot;  not because of my looks but because God made me this way and it is perfect in God&#39;s eyes.,1
2716,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I was quite conflicted by this talk...on the one hand I think she was trying to make a valid point and I could tell she was perhaps a bit nervous of how it would be received. I thought she did a good job, but after reading the barrage of comments I found the whole issue bothering me....sour grapes or a genuine representation of the society we live in??? Either way...we all seem to be pretty superficial don&#39;t we?? As Brene Brown would say..she at least had the guts to &quot;get in the arena&quot; and try and make a statement about how SHE has been treated and viewed by others...based on just the one variable of her looks. And yes...I agree we hear a lot of...looks aren&#39;t everything, money isn&#39;t everything, status and fame isn&#39;t what its cracked up to be...etc etc....and it does seem easier to say those things when you&#39;ve never had to struggle with any of them. It struck me though how many people forgot to mention what I would consider THE most priceless thing that too...is part often of a &quot;lottery&quot;... Or sometimes bad choices rather than the plain and simple genetics and good or bad luck in that department.....NONE of those things matter to me. Because the one thing you need...that nobody seems to acknowledge here...is your health. I GUARANTEE you&#39;ve never heard ANYONE rich, poor,beautiful,ugly, famous or not...say that GOOD health isn&#39;t all its cracked up to be??? Without it there is no way you would worry yourself about all the superficialities of life....because believe me....in my books, being both physically and/or mentally healthy is THE most important commodity in the world. And.....there is beauty in everybody. Be grateful for what you have.",1

2720,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Let off for a speeding offence - yes sure BUT good looks can also work against you - some (perhaps envious or jealous?) people will give you a hard time just because they think you are good looking and have a great life and perhaps because they don&#39;t.

2742,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think she is trying to say that &quot;looks are everything but they should not be everything because we have no control over our genetic makeup.&quot;,1
2743,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So basically your guilt ridden lefty douche who isn&#39;t grateful for the blessings you received,1
2744,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,models are just overpaid hookers,1
2745,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"We all say that looks are the first thing ppl see and it&#39;s true but a lot of people can have a personnality that kinda pops out in a way like if you&#39;re confident and not afraid of talking to others, it&#39;ll be noticeable through your voice or your facial expressions and body language. It is noticeable if you&#39;re open to talking to others and want to make friends or if you&#39;re shy and want to stay alone or if you&#39;re scared to talk to others. Personnality can shine through your looks more than you think. It&#39;s not just when poeple get to know you well but on the first impression, people are not going to see how you look, but how they feel when they&#39;re with you. If they feel comfortable then they will want to spend more time with you but if you make them feel  uncomfortable then it might take more time to let them feel better around you. However if someone doesn&#39;t like you then forget about them who cares about them?? There are lots of other people who will suit your personnality better it&#39;s not if you&#39;re ugly that someone won&#39;t like you and it&#39;s not that your personnality is bad either. People are different. Sometimes they will like your personnality sometimes they won&#39;t",1
2746,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are everything. You are treated better when youre pretty. I know from experience because Im treated badly because Im ugly. Of course a model will say that looks arent everything.,1

2748,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,look arent everything and bro thats is why you become model.What a title ,1

2785,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I honestly think.looks are a matter of opinion. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I also think it&#39;s wrong to offer someone favourable treatment based on their looks and is actually a form of discrimination. It ignores their talent and other qualities. Why shouldn&#39;t someone who is treated better for their looks not their talents not be offended.,1
2786,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A model talking about how looks aren&#39;t everything ,1
2787,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It would be better if you in white dress than black,1
2788,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beauty takes on less significance as you grow older and wiser but there is no denying that in this superficial world we live in.......<br>Youth and beauty does give you an edge or advantage if you know how to capitalize on it....all else being equal.,1
2789,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Genetics is so complex, especially because people initially judge you by what they can see immediately, your looks! <br><br><br><br>When you get to know people on a more personal level, you figure that some people can be really dumb, but of course, you will argue that everyone must have a certain degree of intelligence. When you think that it&#39;s down to genetics, it&#39;s akin to saying that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.<br><br><br>If Einstein won the equivalent of an intelligence lottery, does that make it unfair on other humans? People are more sensitive to race and looks than they are about intelligence because people believe they can become more intelligent. That is not so, you can become better informed, but you cannot learn how to be intelligent. Intelligence on a human is like a boolean and this is important because it&#39;s an aspect that can make or break your life. <br><br><br><br>You will lose your job because you lack intelligence, but your looks are largely insignificant in most industries, and even if you are an actor or model you sometimes still need some degree of intelligence to survive the competition. When you lose your job because of your looks, that is considered discrimination, but you could easily be intelligence impaired and not know about it and no one will think twice about firing you then.<br><br><br>One should never feel guilty about genetic inheritance. When a lion or tiger attack they definitely don&#39;t question their superior genes in relation to their prey, their &quot;legacy&quot; is to be at the apex. The universe is not fair, fairness is a human construct. <br><br><br><br>Humans need 26 fundamental constants in order to try and understand the universe. The human mind is only comfortable with tangible, mathematically precise, and nameable concepts, yet the universe is in flux. Flux means concepts can change, what favours you today may be a disadvantage tomorrow, this challenges you to adapt. Is it common in mathematics for two quantities to have the same value in a complex system? Humans all want to be treated equally, and fairly, this is mathematically impossible, in a utopia perhaps. We are teaching people to be entitled and narcissistic like the universe owes them something. This makes people complacent, and when there is a shift in the forces of the universe (when all you know comes crashing down), it&#39;s very hard to recover because you find you are not prepared and not adaptable enough for a new world. If the universe is in flux, we must also be in flux, vigilant, ready for anything at all times! <br><br><br><br>You can be a part of society, do the things you must do at present, work hard, but don&#39;t fall for the illusion that you have made it. Everything you have can be taken from you at any time, ask a Hurricane survivor or a terminal patient, you think that&#39;s fair? There is no fairness here, be vigilant and take care of yourself. I would refrain from boasting, and feeling self-important about material things and achievements, these are a useless use of time. Today you may be great, but tomorrow you could be less than ordinary, and the next you can be greater... flux... just keep going about your business discreetly and always vigilant.",1

2793,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Alek Wek,1
2794,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There is nothing to argue with her though. She was labelled a model ever since she was young just because of her looks. Her talk here is excellent, as she opens our eyes about how beauty in this current world will only put you in one position, a model and even if she gets to be for an example a doctor, people will tell her to be a model because of her looks. It&#39;s true these models are living under pressure of people who perceive them as nothing but a beauty standard to follow, being tall, having fair skin complexion, and etc, that has become an obsession for young people. Her beauty comes from her own genetic, even if her beauty is natural, people will modify her to fit the highest beauty standard for models. She didn&#39;t get her beauty because she &#39;worked&#39; for it, it comes to her either in the form of blessing or curse. It&#39;s her choice to become anything, but her beauty set her fate to become a model thanks to the society that perceives her as the standard of beauty. Looks aren&#39;t everything is just a title, her point is bigger than that. People can set your future because of your looks. Even if you work for something else, once you&#39;re considered as beautiful, there will always be the pressure for the beauty you attain that pushes you to be something you don&#39;t want.",1

2802,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I wish she did have more time, but the message is powerful still. She is amazingly honest about how society and media has pushed this image of beauty and how having it gives her..others an incredible amount of favor. Yet underneath it she admits the reality that it still doesn&#39;t fulfill. She also is saying subtly that image and perception has been and is a powerful tool in how we see and perceive certain races to be.  Short talk but gives me something to think about. How do I perceive people and things.",1
2803,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"While much of what is said is on point, first impression is lasting and much more difficult to change than a simple clothing swap. However, it is the words that she says after we are no longer distracted by appearance. These are what resonate and tell us who she is. For me, my first modeling shoot, I felt it in my gut, much like her, it felt uncomfortable to arch the back and separate the lips as if you are sucking on a tiny penis. For me, it revolted me and really opened my eyes into what modeling really is, exploiting of women who fit into a mold of what we perceive as beauty. That was the last day I ever did modeling, feeling disgusted in myself for being so naive and being used in this rather dirty feeling photo shoot (however, by today standards it would be rated G). If all of this BS stopped, then girls would finally be happy with themselves no longer seeking fashion, makeup and plastic surgery to feel that they are good enough. Today I buy my natural makeup from a friend who has her own business supporting women (busygirlcosmetics), and I buy clothing from fair trade, small businesses. I do not watch movies or TV shows that require women to expose themselves. I no longer support the exploitation and objectification of women and hope that others will open their eyes and see themselves as the perfect beings they are and not give their monies to these corporations who try so desperately to make us all feel less than.",1

2823,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,White has nothing to do with it. If you&#39;re in a Western nation then it is natural that the most relatable to the demographic will be chosen because of marketability.

Her voice is being wasted on this issue of white privilege and is in fact encouraging opportunitists to be bad actors and excercise reverse racism in the name of equality. This nightmare has left the barn and is running-a-muck. Miss Russell is accomplished enough in her career now to set new standards for the industry. As a consumer I can do my part not to purchase those fashion rags promoting pedophilic idolization. Cameron can miss me with all the self degradation, &quot;I just won the genetic lottery jazz&quot;.

If she had given these PRIMARY and SECONDARY messages... What do you think the audience reaction would have been?",1

2849,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Then why choose to do that job? I understand that if you succeed you can make lots of money , you get to travel a lot , you get to know about fashion and photography etc... But , this industry can be ( and most of the time is ) incredibly toxic. Everything revolves around one&#39;s looks. Individuality and genuine confidence are so likely to be eliminated. Nothing matters but the way you look. Nothing. How disturbing is that? No wonder many models feel very insecure even though their actual job is to represent what being beautiful is like. In spite of all these , they choose to profit from that system and contradict their claims on their instagram accounts where they post either photos of them looking perfect or photos of them being their &quot; everyday self &quot; who is still much better looking than the average person. I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t like models , that would be plain stupid , but I see so much contradiction in the messages some of them they convey. In addition , when they say that we must tackle our perception when seeing a photo of a gorgeous model and after the first impression we must think that this photo has been retouched so that the model looks this way , they must take into consideration that  this thinking process can be done only by people who have reached a certain age and ability of critical thinking. When you upload videos on YouTube of your perfect vacation in an exotic island , taking a swim in your perfect body , you have no control over who sees that. Little kids won&#39;t think of the process behind this video , they just look at a perfect looking person with whom they share no resemblance. By the time they reach an age to have a more critical attitude towards the concept of the image , the damage to their subconscious and confidence has already been done. The only way to escape that would be to unlearn everything you&#39;ve learnt about beauty as a child which is a very difficult thing to do... I just can&#39;t wrap my head around the contradictions coming out of this industry...",1

2864,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think I was very fortunate as a young woman, as I was attractive enough to feel fairly confident that people would respond to me positively on that level (including the guys I was after), but not so beautiful that my brain and personality didn&#39;t have to come into play substantially as well. That said, I was still plenty insecure, as I think virtually all young women (and many young men) are. We have many multi-billion dollar industries that make their money by selling insecurity, and we lap it up like thirsty dogs. This leads to the outrage of someone like a model earning more than a cancer researcher, but that is the way we are.",1

It&#39;s not as if human souls drop down from the sky, tumbling through a giant invisible plinko board and land in random human bodies.  Each person&#39;s genes is the heritage their parents chose carefully to bestow them, based on what their evolved instincts and cultural wisdom advised them to choose, over millennia.  A person is a transient expression of a much larger chain of events and choices that extend both long before and after themselves.  The expression &quot;generic lottery&quot; trivializes the way heritage works by making it sound random, and comes from the idea that heirs of better things have no meaningful claim to what actually is their birthright.  &quot;But you didn&#39;t <b>choose</b> to be beautiful&quot;, the peasant whines, who chose to be resentful.

We are so immature and selfish that it has become a necessity in order to perform in society, job interviews not only judge you by qualifications but looks too, people need cool and good looking friends to hang out with so they feel important specially women, getting dates, these are just a couple of examples. Avoid this toxic crap and focus your energy and effort in your personal growth and start becoming a potential intelligent civilized human being because that is what is going to really define who you are.",1

Attractive, healthy and/or rich people are embodiments or those traits/aspects. The ugly and the weak will eventually get sorted out since those serve no purpose in the improvement and surviving of the genes. Have a look in the animal Kingdom for some perspective.

2964,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks arnt everything but they sure are a huge portion,1
2965,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hmm  it was interesting to hear what she had to say. Im someone who in my daily life doesnt actually get noticed all that much... its because I dont usually always wear the right clothing. I dont usually wear makeup. My hair is either up in a bun or flat... and Im NOT a tall blond blue eyed beauty... so by most peoples standards who know me in normal life would not think this way about me.. plus, when I was younger, I struggled with eating disorders. I never really did recreational drugs and Im sensitive to alcohol consumption, so those were not my things, plus Im an introvert and didnt like the party scene. So I guess you can say that food was my drug of choice if I had to pick my poison, that was it. So, I struggled with being overweight a lot of the time, there were times I would work out, lose weight and look nice and curvy, but most of the time, I was not noticed... but those I worked side by side with and associated with were like that. I remembered being compared with them and of course, I never quite measured up to those I was around. I remembered once meeting a man in Italy and one of the ladies I was aquatinted with told me how beautiful Italian women are and if I wanted to impress him, I gotta make myself hotter than I am. I remembered even ex boyfriends I had would make comments on the beauty of those women and not like that about me...  I remembered how awful and ugly I felt in those moments. But I remembered when MySpace came out. A friend of mine wanted me to make a profile. She did my makeup, had me put on some nice shirts etc... and I admit, I couldnt believe what I saw. When others saw me in that light who already knew me, they couldnt believe it. Even an ex landlady of mine tore me down on how these beautiful photos looks NOTHING like me! She kept saying it wasnt me! She was ruthless about it too!! It nearly killed me inside! I remembered wanting to take my own life the next day! Thats how much it impacted me... &amp; I did pay a professional photographer to do something that I never did before in my life, I took some retro pin up photos. No, theyre not the most beautiful amazing photos that someone ever saw... Im not your classic runway by any stretch! But, I got a lot of compliments and positive feedback nevertheless... it made me feel good. It gave me an ego boost. But at the end of the day, I am haunted by those words and the negative feedback of how Im not enough. I have changed my eating habits and work out regularly. I still dont wear makeup,  in fact, I suck at applying it. I still dress down most days and wear comfortable clothes both for work (CMT so I dont like looking fancy) and I work out too. Every so often, I hear about these women who get catered to and spoiled just because their hot. I dont know how to feel about it? Granted, on one hand I do want to be taken seriously, but on another, sometimes I wonder what its like to be a princess or a queen? Yeah, I do wonder what Im missing or missed? But Im that person who never asked nor expected much from anyone. Im too proud to ask for help unless Im truly in a desperate position. It would honestly be awkward for me to get that kind of treatment. I dont know that I would be able to receive it?",1

Children especially the younger ones like to talk to good looking people .sometimes I feel so bad that I can&#39;t even tell you.

3038,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Its plainly obvious to me that she has no real understanding and what she was talking about. The way she was dressed when she came out on stage and then she said that in the six seconds that it took her to change into something else that hit she just change the viewpoints or opinions of everybody in the audience whatever they were thinking. To be frank, that is a very seriously empty statement that went absolutely nowhere. We all saw what she was wearing when she came out on stage and then in a matter of seconds she changed into something else and said that in the six seconds that she changed her appearance that she also change the minds of the people in the audience regarding the way she was looking. Thats a bunch of nonsense and heres why somebody that is truly good looking somebody that is very gorgeous theyre going to look darn good regardless of how they dress. She did not change the minds or anybody speak to point regarding her appearance in their eyes. She comes out on stage was what shes wearing every guy looking at her saying she is gorgeous and the six seconds that she changes her appearance it has not change the minds of the view points of everyone that was looking at her she still looks Drop dead gorgeous. I guarantee that was the thought of everybody in that audience. Somebody is not good looking because thats what society says as attractive or unattractive or anybody in the entertainment business to say well this looks good and that doesnt look good. If I see a girl walking who is gorgeous Im not saying that because thats what society or the media has labeled her with because of whatever shes wearing or not wearing but because I can plainly see her with my eyes and I look at her and say wow so what the media or society says regarding good looks has absolutely nothing to do with it she could step out of her house and sweat pants all wrinkled up T-shirt and a cup of coffee in her hand to go to her mailbox and get the mail nearly breaking the neck of every guy that walks or drives by and sees her and shes not dressed like a supermodel but looking like she just got out of bed because she probably did but that does not change the fact that shes gorgeous because if you truly are good-looking it does not matter what you where youre going to look darn good no matter what so it doesnt matter what society says what media says what entertainment celebrity say that does not matter I dont need society or the media to tell me what is good looking and what isnt good looking I have eyes and I can see just fine I can go into more detail about this because theres all kinds a holes and everything and she just said. So no its mostly not superficial because the facts are what the facts are and it doesnt matter if your white black Chinese Japanese Korean Vietnamese Saudi Arabia India, I have seen drop dead gorgeous girls from all these foreign ethnic backgrounds so color has absolutely squat to do with it. So it doesnt matter your race or your color if you are gorgeous then youre gorgeous no matter where youre from or if youre very handsome then youre very handsome no matter where youre from and what you wear or dont wear has absolutely nothing to do with it so what society or the media has to say about how are you dress it is only whatever influence they have on that image that they are trying to promote but if you are truly good-looking that doesnt matter at all because youll be very good-looking no matter what you wear at all and so thats just one example of an explanation that blows everything that she just said right out of the water because if you are gorgeous then it doesnt matter there is nothing you have to be insecure about because you look darn good no matter what make up or no make up, Nice hair or wet nest hair it doesnt matter everybody that sees you is going to like very much what they see end it will be very easy to tell.",1

Porque a lo mejor el encargado de turno la ha rechazado para un trabajo, o una compaera le ha dicho que tiene las caderas grandes o la nariz tal. Vete t a saber qu se les pasa por la cabeza. Y no slo en la moda, en la escuela. Muchas mujeres caen en la anorexia por un comentario mal intencionado. Por qu hay personas que disfrutan hiriendo a otras... Y hay que pensar que lo que a uno le resulta feo a otro le resulta precioso, as que es absurdo darle slo importancia a la maldad. Pero somos frgiles. Hay gente preciosa que siente que es menos linda slo por no ser blanca, esto es de locos, porque la belleza es tan diversa... Y hay algo ms atractivo que una persona segura de s misma? Aunque sea ms fea que un pi, se ve hasta bonita. Yo recuerdo que de pequea haba das que me miraba al espejo y me vea increble y ese da triunfaba ms que los Chichos... Y otro da, me vea fea y me volva tmida, retrada... No me pasaba nada reseable ese da, claro. La actitud es el 50%... Si tienes belleza y actitud... Te comes el mundo...

No puedes pasarte de un determinado peso y medidas, tienes que medir tanto, no puedes envejecer... No eres demasiado hermosa, eres demasiado perfecta, queremos algo ms natural... No eres lista, eres guapa. Etc. Ganan dinero por slo ponerse ropa y hacerse fotos. Menudo chollo. El problema es que se las juzga a todas horas y eso les genera mucha inseguridad. Incluso en las relaciones de pareja, al creer que slo estn con ellas por el fsico, su relacin siempre va a estar amenazada por una mujer ms guapa, ms joven o ms lista. Son privilegiadas, obviamente, pero no se las mide con el mismo rasero. Si son suficientemente inteligentes o al menos, fuertes como para no dejarse manipular por las crticas, pues se puede decir que su vida es perfecta, porque tienen slo ventajas. Pero la verdad es que empiezan desde nias y es imposible que no les afecte todo lo malo. Por eso, al final lo importante es aceptarse y querer superarse como persona, sin descuidar el aspecto que es la carta de presentacin, pero sin obsesionarse... Porque a la larga lo importante y lo que queda es la calidad humana, una buena conversacin, un trabajo en el que sentirse realizada y a gusto, con independencia de haber cumplido x aos... Disfrutar de la vida. Hacer cosas buenas por los dems... Vivir. Los jvenes tendemos a creer que slo importa la juventud, pero no es as... Queda mucha vida por delante... no se acaba todo al cumplir 40 o al tener hijos. Uno puede tener una vida plena a cualquier edad, mientras se tenga salud. Creo que la charla de esta chica es muy positiva al describir la realidad de las personas que slo dan importancia al fsico. Al final son esclavas de ello. Adems, el IMC que se considera saludable y ptimo, no coincide con el que estticamente se promueve. En fin, al final la felicidad depende de uno mismo y no es permanente, sino que es momentnea, pero uno decide qu lado del vaso ve... Lleno o vaco...",1

Physical attractiveness is subjective and is seemingly used as a 1st impressions indicator of what a person&#39;s personality is like eg I&#39;m more likely to approach and start a convo with someone who &#39;looks&#39; kind (depending on my subjective features of what a kind person looks like)- not to say I&#39;ll avoid anyone who doesn&#39;t look kind to me (from a 1st impression)- because realisticly we cannot approach everyone we see(so biologically, we follow our own perception of what a person is likely to be like based on a 1st look at them).

Someone may be the most wonderful person inside, great personality, caring, the whole nine yards and yet you wouldnt want to touch him or her with a ten mile pole. Or someone could be with a person who may be just ok or whatever and then someone good looking walks by and that person says daaaaaaamn I would be willing to bet $100,000,000 winning lottery ticket that he or she was wishing they were with that person. Yes I know we are just human but it an inarguable fact that hurts very much those of us who are ugly. I know I cant speak for everyone else but I can speak for myself and that this has been the case each and every single time and so I feel that I could never measure up and ever be good enough or ever be good looking enough completely and totally regardless of what kind of person I am inside my looks could never and will never measure up to anything anybody could ever find truly good looking and anybody that could ever say I am good looking obviously and unmistakably has horrible taste in guys because nothing This Ugly could ever be viewed as good looking and that is just a simple and truthful fact",1
3094,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Guys what she is saying is, being a model is great but you are being judged by other people and it makes you wanna look good in the public eye when you see normal people not caring",1
3095,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That is so easy for her to say because she has looks. But she would be singing to a different song if it were the other way around,1
3096,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Believe me, I&#39;m an attractive model <b>eyeroll</b>",1
3097,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A lot of important facts. Such a great job on delivery. <br><br>She&#39;s basically saying we judge and make decisions on looks. It is sad. People peel the onion first before making your decision. <br><br>Thank you for the great speech.,1
3098,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great talk.,1
3099,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The whole speech is her bragging and she only left me feeling more insecure and miserable,1
3100,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Idiot,1
3101,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Meanwhile some Instagram models can barely string simple sentences.,1

3104,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This talk is pretentious, vain, delusional, a pointless guilt trip towards Caucasian women. Cameron Russell is gorgeous &amp; won a genetic lottery. You are somewhat humble (and that&#39;s great), too bad you can&#39;t just be honest.",1

3106,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok shes gorgeous, benefits from White Privilege, is a model and didnt get beat up by the cops for breaking the law.. now what???",1
3107,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is so pretty, those cheekbones and long legs are amazing ",1
3108,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s so easy to say when you take it for granted,1
3109,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she said the unpleasant truth in a pleasant way,1
3110,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What a load of white guilt horsecrap.<br>So, dont be a model... who cares.",1
3111,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I forget the name of the song but one line says <br>give me a plain wife who will give me a steady life and won&#39;t keep going off the rails.<br>Very true too many women especially western women are high maintenance little princesses who without looks have Fxxx all to give.,1

3116,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The hardest thing to do is to be &quot;ok&quot; with the body, face etc. That you were born with.

3119,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is probably reaching the wall and now she wants to be a professional speaker......,1
3120,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,There is no such of ugly men....There are only men without money......,1
3121,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A more sensible talk would be &quot;Brains aren&#39;t everything, believe me, I&#39;m a model.&quot;",1
3122,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not gonna lie, came here straight up for the comments lol",1
3123,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think the message would have had a stronger impact if it was delivered by an ugly person who has lived a happy and fulfilling life.,1
3124,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How about you stop saving other people?  Minorities don&#39;t need you to champion them. Please stop it.,1
3125,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its like rich people saying money is not everything while they sit on their private jet flying to their private island. Ehhh...sorry beautiful girl with amazing body you didnt convince me at all.,1
3126,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The modeling pictures next to real life pictures.  Wow what an eye opener.  Sending to every single friend with a daughter.,1
3127,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Of course they are. Only a good looking person would say something like that to begin with.,1
3128,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,how many of the models are white in Africa&#39;s fashion scene? China&#39;s? ya thats what i thought... so why is it time and again with the shaming??,1
3129,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are important............. until there not.<br>The most beautiful woman I&#39;ve ever met is an Italian lady from New Jersey.

3131,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything unless you&#39;re a guy who refuses to date anyone other than an extremely hot Chick.  For me , she gotta have a nice personality too. So I guess looks aren&#39;t everything.",1
3132,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s so easy to say that looks don&#39;t matter when you look like a literal goddess lol,1
3133,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That is one very ungrateful girl. She should practice saying &quot;Thank You&quot; several times. For example thank you for opportunity,for health, relationships, for a good mind. How about lifting others up instead of tearing people and things down. Grateful people ARE happy people.",1
3134,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything!<br><br>But nowadays what we see is different.<br>When you are good looking man or a woman it&#39;s easier to get a job, find a match or a &quot;good&quot; friend and be likable for more people. <br><br>+But it&#39;s not about beauty, it&#39;s about confidence. If you believe in yourself and don&#39;t have self doubts, everyone will look at you in a good way. Just love yourself first, be the first one who will love you and then you will feel beautiful and everyone WILL starts to see you as beautiful as you see yourself. Be thoughtful and do not let people to treat you differently. Everyone, every single person deserves the best in life. Do not be brutal to yourself <br><br>And yes! A beautiful soul is way more prettier than beautiful body ",1

3137,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I transformed myself in 6 seconds. No you haven&#39;t you still hot af.,1
3138,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for reasserting what many already believed.<br>Wealth/beauty/fame is not proportional to happiness<br>Brave speech!,1
3139,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks do matter to many but they shouldn&#39;t to any.,1
3140,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"All the people hating on her, because of her looks and job are completely missing the point of the talk. She wasn&#39;t the best speaker that&#39;s for sure, but her point is to look past the outside. Looks don&#39;t make you happy, money doesn&#39;t make you happy,  natural talent doesn&#39;t make you happy. It&#39;s how you use it. If you don&#39;t have good looks, money, or natural talent and you&#39;re unhappy, then guess what if you had those you&#39;d still be unhappy. Her point was to look past superficial things and start seeing the person beneath, you know the same point Martin Luther King Jr made.",1
3141,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,We still have hope guys.,1
3142,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,brilliant!,1
3143,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Being ugly also gives you a valuable perspective, for instance people will judge you negatively simply because they don&#39;t like your stupid face...it&#39;s really enlightening, I must say",1
3144,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,OH STFU !!!!!,1
3145,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes they sadly are :)),1
3146,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Realty is  Looks and Money are EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE at least nowadays. Who has it they only speak like this.,1
3147,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sexy,,Hot,,Beautiful",1
3148,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What if, unlike the average person, you find models to be ugly and just don&#39;t get it at all?",1
3149,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I absolutely love this. Wish this could be shown everywhere. I appreciate her beauty on the inside.,1
3150,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She lost it when I reas Believe Me, I&#39;m a Model",1
3151,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I have been saying it for years. Looks and opportunity have always gone together. We miss out on so many brilliant people because we have eyes. It is beautiful to see an honest person . Thank you,1
3152,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I honestly think that you actually start to believe the &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything, thing,&quot; when you get older. Especially if you run into or date a lot of unsavory people.  <br><br>That said, being hot/handsome helps.",1
3153,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I only liked this cuz shes hot...,1
3154,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Rubbish,1
3155,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Believe me, money is not everything, however, without money, u r nothing.",1
3156,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Heres how we debunk this statement: say youre good looking dude. Bingo: you can wear ANYTHING and look great. And now imagine someone with wide hips and narrow calves and  11 feet- youre fucked, spending your whole life looking for clothes that looks okeyish. And from a health standpoint - the more proportionate you are, the more stress your body can take and thats physiology so zip it",1
3157,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Women aren&#39;t allowed not to be beautiful. It&#39;s subconscious for everyone now to judge a woman by her beauty, no matter what she is or does. And I hate it",1
3158,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Being a model means less precisely because she&#39;s a model.   Almost no one who has said  &#39;Money isn&#39;t everything&#39; or &quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything&quot;   would be willing to give up all of the things and opportunities having an overabundance of either one has given them. And those willing to give them up probably will be very surprised when things are taken away from them that they thought wasn&#39;t based on either of these two things.,1
3159,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I worked a little bit on that department retouching photos, well I can surely say that all photos are edited on the smallest detail",1

3165,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I worked 20 years as Stylist and can aprove the &quot;Industry&quot; just sucks......model agents are mostly gay (no worrys with that @ 2 of my 5 best friends are gay) BUT they choose the girls skinny and allmost boy looking.  This sucks so much and no wonder they have so much problems with eating problems.....Laetitia Casta was a light on the sky but she was sadly a 1 hit wonder :(,1
3166,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron, you&#39;re beautiful inside and out !!!!!",1

3169,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;I&#39;m sorry for being beautiful, i swear, it&#39;s not my fault.&quot;       <br><br><br>She&#39;s funny thou",1
3170,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is one of the best talks I&#39;ve heard!  Thank you,1

3172,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,And who wears that in that picture,1
3173,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s not that pretty,1
3174,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,WOW!! that&#39;s powerful,1
3175,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I never had self esteem issues and always felt happy with how I looked. always had men tell me straight out that I was beautiful and never had any issues with attracting men so I always assumed that I was an attractive looking woman. I never used it to my advantage, I always found that women were very insecure around me and very jealous so it was difficult to work with women, men always expected me to &#39;behave &#39; a certain way! At age 37 I underwent brain surgery to remove an acoustic neuroma brain tumour. the facial nerve was damaged and as a result I have very little movement on the left side of my face causing asymetry and speech issues. After the initial shock  and I couldn&#39;t recognise my face I realised how differently people were treating me. It was incredible how differently people treated me. Men do not approach me or talk to me anymore and women don&#39;t pay much attention or indulge ,e with the pity party talk. The insecure jealous types were no longer intimadated and let out their real side!   It made me realise how differently people behave around beautiful people and how superficial they can be, I quess hiding the self worth issues they face when they are confronted with some one who has something that they wish for themselves. In saying that I can understand it now, when I see people smile broadly or blink both of their beautiful eye lashes (men and women) I am cringing and wishing dearly that I could do that.I never had self esteem issues before or cared that much about what others thought of me, so I can understand how people who do not consider themselves to be beautiful would begrudge and dismiss someone who does receive alot of attention because of their looks. But I still don&#39;t sympathise because it is up to each individual to engage with their own gifts and talents and find their own sense of worth . And stop feeling sorry for themselves and , self pity is a coping mechanism and if you work through it you learn how to self sooth instead!",1
3176,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I would love to  hear more about her experience,1
3177,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,At least she is being honest from her point of view.,1

It doesn&#39;t detract from the fact that she is a beautiful women, pretending to be dismayed and outraged by the advantages physical beauty brings...whilst still benefitting from it (if she is really that outraged  - why doesn&#39;t she quit modelling?)",1
3183,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just another rich girl with white guilt she wouldn&#39;t change a thing just wants to be seen as p.c,1

And besides a few sweethearts they are shallow people.  They are literally Goddesses, the medias ideal beautiful young women.  But everyone I know hates them.  They are that infamous.  It took me a while to come to terms with, but honestly, I thought I was the only one.  The are SO MEAN!  And I&#39;ve realized they are insecure.  I may see them as perfect little devils but yet, they too are struggling. So model or not I guess we can&#39;t all be that happy, unless we learn to love ourselves.

If you&#39;re gifted with &quot;intelligence&quot;, you&#39;re gonna try to do something with it and its natural and normal, if you&#39;re gifted with abilities in arts, you probably will try to achieve something related to arts for a living, if you&#39;re gifted with &quot;beauty&quot;, why do you feel free to judge her because of using it.

SOOOOO much of the time when a person says that looks aren&#39;t everything, or you shouldn&#39;t worry about looks, that person ONLY dates people who are super hot.  That&#39;s not to say this woman does, I really don&#39;t know.  But the VAST majority of the time, this is the case.",1
3236,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its very evident she doesnt believe what shes saying,1
3237,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Watch:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAOQp0MzBSM"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAOQp0MzBSM</a> : Helpful tips to stay merry and bright- avoid holiday burn out during this Christmas &amp; new year season.",1
3238,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well its something to think about. Knowing some very famous and (unintentionally) influential people, this model should not or appear to blame herself for certain woes in society. I take it she feels insecure by the very virtue that her profession is cutthroat. The same influential people mentioned above parlayed their success in many good ways. She probably makes millions very easily and seemingly blames or compares herself against the woes of society. Ive created images of some well known celebrities and gave them their photos. It was appreciated. Learn to love yourself more. Intermixing or comparing self only exacerbates problems.",1
3239,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"For everybody saying that what shes saying is useless and that she should create change by not following modelling agencies beauty standards (basically she must gain fat)...heres the thing. When you write this you make it seem as if shes changing herself for other people. She could very well be happy being thin and healthy and she doesnt have to create that body just for modelling agencies. Why should she change her body to make people who dont look like her happier? By saying she shouldnt have a certain look youre contradicting yourself when you say she shouldnt follow others beauty standards - because you want her to follow YOURS. Heres the hypocrisy. Anyway, I thought her talk was really informative and shes a great and humble person. She is bringing forward positive changes by acknowledging that her beauty makes society treat her better than other people, a phenomenon she truly wants to change. Shes a great woman and this was a great talk ",1
3240,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People like good looking people but tall and slender folks arnt always what someone thinks is beautiful. But all in all beauty can be acquired by anyone in one way or another. I do get sick of good looking women being required to apologize to someone for looking good because some people don&#39;t like their bodies. Thats those peoples decision to decide that they like their bodies and shed off the lies of the media of what is beautiful. People need to start being responsible for their own self images and quit waiting for society to comfort them about how they feal about how society veiws their image. If you dont feel beautiful thats your own fault for allowing yourself to feel that way. Quut blaming the hot model for being hot. Soemone somewhere probably thinks your hot for who you are unless you dont bath and stink or something and heck in the world we live in someone probably gets off on people with bad hygiene. So I guess the ball is your court not her with all her model apologetics.,1
3241,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wonderful honest talk!  Well done!,1
3242,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Same like rich people saying money isn&#39;t everything <br><br>The statement is Kinda true but you can only say that if you don&#39;t have to worry about money,1
3243,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Rich people says that---- Money is not every thing and  beatifull face says that ..... <br>looks is not everything .... <br>but it&#39;s a factor who don&#39;t have those,1
3244,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,only one thing I can appreciate from this talk is that main point is assured by views of this very video. E.g. this vid has 22 milion and more views which is much much more than Neil deGrasse Tyson`s vids explaining major principles of universe. So sad reality for humankind and state of social mind!,1
3245,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But she is too much beautiful,1

3247,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,of course when u are model u dont understand how ugly people feel. looks is everything. if ugly guy with hot GF said that looks doesnt matter then i believed.,1
3248,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thanks for an excellent talk. I am old, and I am from an ancient culture (which at least had ancient wisdom orientation, decades ago). There is saying, which no one listens to any more, that beauty is skin deep.  What that also means is that a man can get prettiest woman in his life, and he will then find out many surprising facts. One that she is not pretty all the time, second that if she gets a cold, she will sneeze and have runny nose, as is expected and not look so pretty, and third that the construction that goes with looking beautiful, at times may become burden for her. To feel truly loved, even the most beautiful woman, would wish to be loved also, when she looks ugly, or when she is without construction. Back in time, when wisdom reigned, people were not instantaneously judged based on looks only. We waited to hear what they say, and what their values are. As humans, we were not walking around on the planet to reduce other humans to judgements,  based on a 20 second look. Yes, we as a society, in America, (may be in other countries as well), we have become that shallow and superficial.",1
3249,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,nice event / speech !,1
3250,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks arent everything ? Ok but fact is good looking people starts their life on recruit difficulty and ugly people on veteran,1

3252,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Stop and frisk was a success and shootings and crime in NY went down. You want to complain and label these programs as institutionalized racism,  and Innocent people die because of it. Why  don&#39;t you complain about the people carrying firearms used to commit crime? No harm was done to the people that were stopped by the police. Did you ever stop to consider it&#39;s more likely the people committing crimes with a firearm are non-whites? The stabbings that occurred the other day at the Habakkuk celebration in NY might have been prevented if Stop and Frisk was still the law.",1

3263,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What she is saying is nice. But its too idealistic. I lost about 20lbs recently, and its shocking how much men pay attention. I went from being invisible at parties, to men gawking at me. So strange how such a small change has made such a difference. Long story short, being slim and wearing makeup with good clothes makes people treat you like a goddess. Why not try to be as attractive as physically possible? Obviously people only have what they are born with, but its good motivation to go to the gym and to eat healthy.",1

3268,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I can tell she was nervous giving this talk.  I think it was a bit short, but it was interesting all the same.",1
3269,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I like how she owned up to the fact that her privilege has enabled her career to progress in the way that it has, as well as how she highlighted how others suffer because they lack these privileges. However, one thing I would like to know is why she wanted to be a model and persisted with it; particularly if it makes her feel so insecure. I wouldn&#39;t want to be thrown into a job that makes me insecure day in and day out",1
3270,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Pick your country, your friends, your education,  and do what you want.",1
3271,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,its the same like saying money is not everything. Well if you are poor and cant afford food.. money can save your life,1
3272,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,All this &quot;truth&quot; and she cherry picks. What you have pretty lady is called white guilt. That is all. You mention the 120k black and latino kids stopped in 2011 and forget to mention why. Well I&#39;ll assist you. It&#39;s because they have made themselves the problem. You wouldn&#39;t know this watching your white guilt CNN and taking every black or latino kids word for what happened or how they act. You think they&#39;re so innocent huh? Go walk alone in one of those neighborhoods and see what happens as a pretty white woman. Try to control your white guilt it&#39;s not a good look.,1

3286,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<b>If you REALLY want to help and reach the feelings of the ones who are not a fortunate as you are, first make sure you are not communicating the opposite message with your actions.</b><br>It would be better if instead of just openly admitting that she is treated better due to her lucky and continue taking advantage of privileges based on her job (which is doing and looking how others want you to) she would communicate a message of acceptation with other premises.  Doing another kind of activism by stopping following the toxic beauty standards of nowadays modelling agencies that doesn&#39;t promote what she is &quot;criticising&quot; here would help too.",1
3287,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"As she brought up race and Western perceptions of beauty; l should point out that this, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=7m28s"">7:28</a>, applies to White teenagers, among Black girls it is almost the reverse statistic.

3301,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well .....she is very honest. And she&#39;s right, looks aren&#39;t everything. Maybe she started out well because of her looks. Maybe got away with things like not paying for a ticket. But all models get older, have heart breaks, have insecurities like she said etc.etc. As for as men treating you better, it really depends on the man you marry, date etc. Our President was married two 2 beautiful woman and married presently to a beautiful woman, a former model and cheated on all 3 of them. There are countless examples of beautiful women, models who have been cheated on and had their hearts broken.

3317,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m not a model, and I don&#39;t consider myself pretty but I am fairly attractive  or so they say (again, I am not really the vain type, don&#39;t put on makeup and basically am a wash and wear type of girl who just wants to do boyish things)(though, I think I got admirers and suitors hugely due to my personality, I guess it didn&#39;t hurt that I wasn&#39;t that bad looking). At first, I enjoyed it. I&#39;ll admit that. In high school, I never understood why boys fawned over me and sent me numerous love lettersand before you get irritated hear me out: Yes, it was fun. But when I got older, and moved to professional life, those advances got really ugly. Sexual harassment and sexism etc. left and right and it got to point where when my hair started thinning and graying, I was actually happy and greatly relieved to be spared from all that &quot;superficial&quot; attention because as pathetic as it sounds, it&#39;s actually easier to see the REAL people, friends, and situation if every single circumstance wasn&#39;t greatly reliant on your looks. I realized that a lot of people who &quot;admired&quot; me, actually thought that was all there is to me, that I looked neat but there was no way I could be smarter than men (sorry, this is just an example, and it&#39;s the most common one that comes to mind, I have nothing against men), and there&#39;s no way I could hold a directorial position or be intelligent enough to write a script etc. etc. etc. Even if I actually did prove myself time and again, there will always be people who will look at you and give you judgemental stares, and you know they&#39;re summing you up based on superficial factors. It was tough. I used to like taking pictures, but it got to a point where I developed a phobia for pictures of myself because it reminded me of the sheer overpowering vanity of the world. When I started speaking my mind, the boys who used to like me would shame me. It&#39;s all a very shallow game, really. The game of physicality. I know no matter how sincere, it will always sound hypocritical, but I guess what she&#39;s trying to say is: if attention is all you want, sure good looks are a blast. But if you are the type of person who values more than that, like a person&#39;s attitude and mind, and the depth of character, and doing good, and all the truly beautiful things on the inside etc, it kind of sucks to always have a person judge you first and foremost based on your looks. And then stop there.",1

3381,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,We all clicked that video because of her good look. If she were ugly we would have not clicked and she  would not be talking about her ugliness.,1
3382,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Even a model needs to express her personality in a photo shoot some will do this better than others. Even among the considered beautiful there is a hierarchy. You can never escape it.,1
3383,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Your so vein,you probably think your the only one,NO!",1
3384,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I guarandamntee you she wouldn&#39;t be caught dead with an ugly guy as a boyfriend.  She is right.  But talk is cheap.,1

3393,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But she&#39;s still a model and she&#39;s perpetuating the stereotype by way of her career choice.,1

3397,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I wish she had mentioned the fact that there are barely any trans models, and the fact that were severely held back in life, too. Just for being trans, and/or visibly gender non-conforming",1
3398,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nothing worse than an ugly woman who thinks shes beautiful just because some horn dogs paid some attention to her.,1
3399,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Well for me looks are everything because i don&#39;t want ugly husband.,1

3420,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am ugly, but I am happy :P",1
3421,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I suppose it&#39;s a good thing that she became a model because otherwise she is parroting stereotype opinions without having an original thought of herself.,1

3429,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Studies have shown that attractive people are treated better, happier and more successful in life. Its true that looks arent everything but its a poor counter point to make when the benefits of being perceived as attractive vastly outweigh the negatives. Naturally beautiful people look good without make up or photo editing.",1

3435,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Facial exercises can tone your face  after a few years.  There is loads of videos on YouTube about facial exercises..  It won&#39;t give you a big change like plastic surgery or botox.,1

3443,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This took courage and a degree of humility.  She didn&#39;t have to do this.  She could have continued her way through life enjoying all the perks of being born with great looks.  Instead she touched on the inherent racism and sexism of our culturally programmed obsession with skinny white women, as well as the psychological damage this obsession does to otherwise healthy and bright young women.  Not to mention the inherent injustice of treating cute white girls differently than everyone else, male or female, white or non-white (and for that matter young or not young).  She is right... there is so much more to being a happy, fulfilled, content, valuable human being than mere looks.  Why can&#39;t we convince young women of this?",1

3474,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel so dark struck. YEAH! There is a clear privliage in looks that seems so cliche until a person who is one of the best looking people according to our society is speaking substance about the issues other feel and cannot escape because of thier genetic formation. THANK YOU... 6 years later :),1

3476,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just mentioning a few statistics and saying these numbers are a proof that we are all racists is just bullsh*t, the same way it&#39;s bullsh*it to state the number of non white people committing crimes proportionally to the number of white people and therefor concluding that they&#39;re more violent. There are many factors and reasons why these statistics occur, it doesn&#39;t just end at &quot;because the cops are racist, etc.&quot;, it is one factor yes but only of a numerous different others unknowns in the global equation. <br>This is why I think statistics should be taught starting at a very young age, politicians and others are using statistics to convince the uneducated public to believe in their own distorted views.",1

3483,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The thing is looks are not everything, but if you do have them, you have a lot more priveleges, as people treat you differently. And btw,it&#39;s nothing to do with being whiteLol,why?",1
3484,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It took guts for her to say these things and then I read the comments and realise that society will never change. You will believe what you have been told to believe for years and because of that looks will always stay everything because no one is willing to change.,1
3485,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks arent everything tells a super hot model.<br>Yeah right.,1
3486,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She doesn&#39;t say looks aren&#39;t everything. What she says is that being attractive is a matter of luck and has many benefits but it doesn&#39;t guarantee a happy life and comes with it&#39;s own set of problems. Unattractive people are too busy feeling sorry for themselves to relate.,1
3487,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Youre not a model because youre pretty, youre a model because youre photogenic. A great majority of models are not pretty as their pretty can be wiped off with Kleenex in 10 seconds.",1

But, please do continue to tell me all about how looks are so superficial and how life as a globe-trotting model is so unfulfilling, how people bend over backwards to earn your approval and how young girls shower you with adoration and questions about how they can be like you. Life is so hard. <br><br>Here&#39;s a newsflash for you: a career model being insecure about how she looks is just as sympathetic as a billionaire being insecure about not having enough money. You&#39;ll forgive me if I don&#39;t lose any sleep over it.",1
3489,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,we should start castrating the ugly ones so everyone is beautiful in next 100 years,1
3490,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything true. But this is something we have to come to terms with at some point during our lives. The thing is that looks matter because the majority of people thinks it does. It really doesnt but if you&#39;re getting hired or fired based off ya looks well then that makes big difference on things.,1
3491,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You seem to be reluctant to to say your white privilege there sweetheart.. You are pretty, yes in some ways. Your life of being privlaged does not correspond with the rest of white People, in your words. I care not for models but for only my wife and family. I work hard every day do hope they all aspire to be better than your thoughts. If you do not like your &quot;privlages&quot; then join us an the working class of society.",1
3492,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A bit self-indulgent really.,1
3493,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Booohoo i&#39;m so sad i&#39;m beautiful but i&#39;ve made tonnes of money out of the industry and i was too naive to know i had a choice and do something else with my career. Easy to berate your looks and it&#39;s effects when you&#39;re beautiful. The problem with this is it&#39;s an insult to those who aren&#39;t genetically blessed. Rather than sulking and stating and realising the obvious; that indeed the industry is lead by consumerist&#39;s idealised beauty standards. She should be thankful with the economic success she&#39;s gained from it and move on. Fair point about the sexualisation at a young age. Where were her parents or a good agent or her own voice? If she&#39;s got such a huge problem with the whole industry then why is she still doing it? Such a hypocritical speech.,1

3503,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Every girl that wants to be a model is really saying, they want to be wanted, desired, admired and loved.  We care about what others think because we are pegged and no one want to be pegged as undesirable, but that is our culture.  Super models are given so much for something they didn&#39;t create, it&#39;s the same for athletes, yes, they work hard but a short legged girl is not going to run as fast as a long legged girl, body type matters and you&#39;re either born with it or you&#39;re not.  Moral of the story is, life is not fair.  It always amazes me when someone says, &quot;You can be anything you want to be.&quot;  That is simply a lie with a few exceptions.",1
3504,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why is this in my recommendation now?<br>6 years later,1
3505,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lets hate some white people today, again :) and remember kids after I show you all of my gorgeous pictures that &quot;looks dont really matter&quot; :D",1
3506,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Im a good looking person and yes, I get all the benefits. If I want a girl, I know I can get her because of my look. But the point is that no one wants you because of your personality for example. Its a lot easier if youre good looking, but people dont see the other side",1

I wonder that when they get some terror like being set fire or being poured acids on their face, would they still say same words? Looks aren&#39;t everything? This is the most arrogant and naive word. Stop deceiving and Wake up! The world isn&#39;t that beautiful as you think!

But wouldnt you rather be able to drink a cup of coffee on a misty morning and feel mentally at peace than look in the mirror and say wow you have an incredibly symmetrical face. Honestly mental health is a huge genetic lottery as well, and one that is way more important. Looks only matter as much as you let them. We all live on planet earth and this is how it works.

3568,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sad thing is, most people are average looking, not ugly.<br>Few people are truly &quot;ugly&quot; they&#39;re just out of shape or improperly groomed. <br>I was unattractive growing up. Puberty sucked. I had the worst haircut, didn&#39;t know how to dress myself, and I forgot to shower or brush my teeth sometimes. I didn&#39;t really care about my image, until I realized it really was hurting my social life. My personality sucked too; way too introverted and cowardly. <br>But I blossomed, eventually. I hit the gym, got a decent haircut, decent clothes, became friendlier with people, and now I&#39;m considered attractive by most people I meet.<br><br>I understand both ends of the spectrum.

3573,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks do matter. As someone who was ugly when I was young and now attractive, I cant tell you how much your looks aide you in life. I developed avoidant personality disorder and extreme body dysmorphia because I was neglected and bullied for my looks as a child. Now that Im societally attractive, its hard to even go outside and feel comfortable. But people DO treat me so differently. The entire world becomes your friend. Everybody is kind to you. I cant imagine how different my life would be if I was attractive from the start. If kids wanted to be my friends and I wasnt bullied for my appearance.

3579,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Before I watched this, I thought she was going to talk about the male models and how they or maybe most of them are men (and I&#39;m not sexiest or a feminist or anything like that) who are complete jerks who have no respect for others at all and don&#39;t really even have respect for themselves and just live a life of ignorance and arrogance and just a terrible life. Nope, BUT I&#39;m thankful that she talked about what she did talk about. Those things still need to be mentioned and acknowledged. <br>Everyone should begin a daily habit of avoiding magazines that have those kinds of images in them. So boys/ men won&#39;t go on thinking and believing that that&#39;s what girls should look like and that&#39;s the only kind of sexy or attractiveness that should exist or that is normal. Some girls may naturally and Healthily be that skinny and others don&#39;t look like that when they are healthy AND THAT&#39;S OK. As long as your healthy. We ALL need to stop comparing our skin and body to look like someone else. I&#39;m NOT saying if your overweight (fat) is ok. If I were to do that that would be foolish, why? Because that&#39;s unhealthy. We ALL should be promoting HEALTHY WEIGHT, NOT being obese is A OK. That&#39;s ridiculous! Don&#39;t go out with someone just because of their outward appearance and don&#39;t go living believing that being obese is healthy and ok and don&#39;t go living believing that hard work is any negative word or even beneath you or anyone else.",1
3580,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In all honesty, looks determine the way you are treated, what you are given, and so on. Please don&#39;t take her point out of perspective. At the end of the day we&#39;re all insecure. Skinny girls aren&#39;t BAD aren&#39;t EVIL aren&#39;t sl*** or ho***. Overweight girls aren&#39;t GROSS or MORBID or UGLY. But it is societies pressure to look a certain way, to act a certain way, all for sexual pleasure.<br><br>I am skinny, honestly I am insecure.<br>It sounds like a terrible thing to say, &quot;oh but you&#39;re healthy and attractive and bla bla&quot; You know what I see in the mirror? An ugly naked mole rat. Idk what to say for expression that won&#39;t offend anyone.<br><br>Honestly I&#39;m happy body positivity is a thing now. I think thicc girls are cute and beautiful, I think girls of color are some of the most beautiful models, so why does what I&#39;m saying sound offensive to some of you?<br><br>Being a model. Being a model does not make you happy, does not make you the most secure person, does not mean you&#39;re snotty and stuck up, does not mean that you must have had so many plastic surgeries.<br><br>You look at fashion magazines, amazon fashion, mall fashion. You want to see what the clothes look like so there ya go a model.<br><br>In my opinion, models go through the most strenuous health regimens. Yes, times have changed and we are seeing more beautiful plus sized and skinny girls. But back then it was no eating and working out with little to no food whatsoever, watch your water intake, and make sure you look absolutely perfect.<br><br>What I am trying to say.<br><br>We all have different body types.<br>All body types are beautiful.<br>I absolutely mean that.<br><br>I have a fast metabolism.<br>See?

3588,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If you feel happy in yourself then life is easier and happier . More important that other peoples opinion on your looks. <br>A beautiful looking person can turn very ugly with an ugly personality and if you aren&#39;t great looking but you make the best of your looks and have a fantastic personality you will be attractive to others.  If you are ugly on the inside and ugly on the outside then things won&#39;t be good and it&#39;s your own fault .,1
3589,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,WHAT I TOOK FROM THIS VIDEO<br>Who ever runs the magazine/model world is a fuckin pedo. She said she didnt have her first period when she started modeling. Someone looked at this 10-13 year old girl and thought she belongs on the cover looking like a woman &quot;she is beautiful she would she look like grown up&quot; im sure girls/women are shown the treachery of man very early on so i should just shut up and let the world be its disgusting self. Thats hard to do. We need to stop objectifying woman and children. One day we will either accept one another or we will be in a perpetual war that just doesnt stop tearing society apart.,1
3590,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I my view only character matters not looks,1

If we compare that to an ugly person, who is most likely also insecure about their looks because they&#39;re not considered attractive, AND does NOT get a golden pass for the other parts of life (like her example of a speeding ticket).

3628,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"We are all beautiful, its just that there were retarded people on the media, magazines doing ads about how a woman or how a man should look like , and the insecure ones are the ones who apply those standards on themselves. Be yourself stop trying to look like other people. You are an amazing creation made by the same creator who created the sky , stars , mountains,  and animals , you are amazing! + look at what your amazing body and your brain can do!!! I dont think many people realize that , please do and except yourself and love it because you are awesome and please dont try to look like other people who follow dumb sick standards! We were all born beautiful so stop wasting time trying to fix yourself and instead of picking out your flaws,  embrace them!START LIVING!!! ",1

3640,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is sweet and I liked this but I do wonder how she feels about being a part of a system that creates these constructions. Because she made an excellent impact with those photo comparisons but I wish she had more message about it&#39;s impact.

Oh, just look at all the top comments saying &quot;Lmao only hot people say looks don&#39;t matter!&quot;. Near the end, she said that she found it hard to come up on stage and comment on the gender and racial biases... while also benefiting from them. Which made me tear up in the club y&#39;all.

A very beautiful girl has not good language good scence of humour ..I think her beauty exists for very short time in our mind ....so looks matter for short time but enternal beauty matter for long time,1

That, is the tragedy. Knowing that you took part in the lowering of a whole society&#39;s self esteem...that would make me feel pretty insecure too.

3658,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Whats wrong with being a model ?? Every profession has an important role in our society? Why pit one against the other? Demonizing feminine characteristics like beauty seems to be a trend nowadays. Truth is she has stepped in an industry she doesnot like and now she is not happy. The only bit where I agree with her is that models are looked down upon in our society but ironically she too is doing the same by badmouthing the profession.,1

Ma  tutta una mia percezione e mi sta mandando in brandelli il cervello. Vorrei essere &quot;ugly&quot; a volte per non concentrarmi sull&#39;aspetto fisico, ma pi sui sentimenti veri, sui discorsi delle persone e capirli, guardare in faccia le persone senza pensare a me ma pensando a loro e ascoltarli.<br>Questa ragazza  splendida (oltre che essere una gran figa, ok), per ha qualcosa da dire e ha avuto il coraggio di dirlo davanti a una platea.

My mother was a model for a short time in the 1940s and I grew up really wishing modeling would be something for me. But it only took a little maturity to realize it wasnt in the cards for me.  More idealistic young girls need to see this talk so they get the real story. Thank you.

As i shambled back to my hovel on bandy legs people stared at the ugly piebald dwarf. Children screamed and ran when i reared my disfigured head. I am sitting here in the dark, not because the electricity is cut off...but because i can&#39;t stand to look at myself. My razor is in my hand and i can feel the love it has for my wrist. In my dreams i am accepted. Perhaps i will dream forever...<br>...but hey, looks aren&#39;t everything right...RIGHT?",1
3745,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Liar,1

3748,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"White women are more attractive by every sociological measure you can perform. More responses on dating websites ect. Ya sorry, some races of people are more attractive than others. A pygmy is not as aesthetically pleasing to the eyes as a blond haired nordic beauty with long legs and perky breasts. Truth is a rough thing. Its not oppression, its a capitalist response to hire what is in most demand.",1
3749,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thank you for sharing this and being honest . i am sure people would consider that and know the right thing to do . good luck to you,1
3750,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot;  We know THE WALL is undefeated.,1
3751,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are everything,1
3752,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She was trying to convey a message that was heartfelt and genuine, which was obvious if one observed her closely. I applaud her. Kudos, Cameron.",1
3753,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah, in a &quot;perfect&quot; world there&#39;d be even distribution of resources and world peace too. Never gonna happen. Everything thats &quot;wrong&quot; with the world can be tied to our baser instincts. We&#39;re predisposed to valuing beautiful things over ugly things. You can&#39;t alter that anymore than you could the law of gravity.",1
3754,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was nice. I still want a lobotomy though.,1
3755,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"By my proper experiences, i need to be disagree with the title (i don&#39;t listen to the all conference). I am alone since 23 years now and i try a lot of things to change my mindset and my body but i am still sad.",1
3756,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everything she says is true. And I still fancy her so much because of the legacy she referred to. I associate her appearance as being something that would comfort me.,1
3757,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks shouldnt be a final judgement, but certain aspects of looks CAN reflect health.",1
3758,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She never   talked about how big models are actually transgendered men just like herself. Yep I know you think she is a real woman, but she is not.. We have all be so deceived, it&#39;s hard for most to realize the lies...",1
3759,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You just have to have a positive behavior,.. cute is ok for everything.,.",1
3760,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Rich People: Money isnt everything<br>Beautiful People:  Looks arent everything<br>Skinny People: I wish I could gain weight<br><br>Neither knows what the other 1% go through with life giving the beautiful and rich  1st dibs to everything.,1
3761,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she sounds so out of breath...,1
3762,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ahh another guilt ridden leftist on stage for all to view.  Being born in America is the lottery.,1
3763,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very beautiful women are often very dissapointing as people. They never have had to work at being likeable or interesting and they haveno  personalities; they are like white bread.,1
3764,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Courageous. Well done.,1
3765,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fati vedere cici bella non siamo al cinema,1
3766,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything... but they are everything.,1
3767,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To the speaker - I admire and respect your courage, your authenticity and your brute honesty. I loved how you challenged the bias that society places a high value over physical appearance as supposed to what an individual has/can achieve. I hope I have not misunderstood the message of this talk as other people have mentioned in comments. I can not imagine given your standing that was any way easy for you to do.. so kudos! And well done:-)",1
3768,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,BULLSHIT,1
3769,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything, I&#39;m a model&quot; Also feminists &quot;You can&#39;t see your own privilege&quot; (aka I have no evidence) However, the halo effect is a well documented effect. It&#39;s almost like have a double puddy pass.",1
3770,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The modeling industry is one of the dirtiest,next to politics...full of pedophiles,racist,drug dealers and pimps.Not the models,they are victims just like the prostitutes their pimps use them as much as they can,the younger the girls are the more they&#39;re worth,and when they are old and not as profitable as before...they&#39;re tossed like garbage,and the next new younger girl replaces them.The difference between these low lives who control the industry, and the street low lives on the steet...is the modeling industries are the upper class pimps,street pimp are the lower class,but in reality they are the same kind of garbage and work the same way for example... models are upper class hookers and street hookers are the lower class.Not all models and prostitutes end up the same but the majority end up either addicted to drugs,suicide,or die murdered,HIV, or over dose.I teach my daughter not to be like the poor ignorant,idiots who let society set the standard,on beauty,wardrobe,and how people should feel...in my opinion that&#39;s similar if not the same as slavery !!",1
3771,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not everything but 90% ,1
3772,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Mind is just an illusion&quot; Believe me, Mind.",1
3773,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Have you ever noticed that it&#39;s always the people that are pretty that tell the rest of us that looks aren&#39;t that important,1
3774,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well sorry but I&#39;m tired of pretty people saying that beauty isn&#39;t everything. Of course it isn&#39;t, but as she said, more attractive people get things for free. As an ugly person, I don&#39;t even get that. I don&#39;t get anything, so at least pretty people have their beauty.",1
3775,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is an excellent talk by a reflective, intelligent young woman. But my main takeaway after watching this video and then reading though the comment section is that more people should watch the fucking video!",1
3776,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,LOL! When I lived in Kentucky for a while I actually enjoyed  hearing tall slender white women complaining how none of the guys liked them or thought they we&#39;re attractive. I noticed a lot of men in Kentucky preferred women on the heavier side. This was back in the early 2000s I don&#39;t know how it is now though.,1
3777,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yall are so dumb and ignorant in these comments . it must suck not being able to comprehend the message shes trying to put out smh.,1
3778,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are like a pilot of a show. It doesn&#39;t really guarantee your success. However if your pilot is rejected then you can&#39;t really do anything.,1
3779,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bullshit,1
3780,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,In the western world looks and appearance are everything she may not like it but that&#39;s how our society is you don&#39;t have to have super model good looks but it helps .,1
3781,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think Ms. Monroe said it best. Beauty is to men what money is to women. Not everything but it helps.,1
3782,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She seems pretty well grounded. Thx for sharing,1
3783,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The self loathing here is off the charts. Learn to love yourself. God does.,1
3784,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The problem in our society is that there are small group of the population that considered themselves elites. because they think they are better and more informed that everyone else. so they feel like they have to preach to others. that is why TED talk was created. TED talk does not offer any useful or even real information. its just a place for the elites.,1
3785,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"    ,    ",1
3786,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think people strive to get things, and after they have received those things, they realize there is more to life than that - money and looks. I have a wealthy friend who will always tell me that money makes his life easy but also insecure about the quality of people who come close to him. it carries him to a point and from there, he has to figure things out himself. When I look in the mirror, I like the face that looks back at me, it very beautiful but I have a challenge making and keeping friends. so I get her point.",1
3787,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks is not important but<br>people judge other by their looks everyday.,1
3788,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thick thighs only plz,1
3789,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<b>&quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything, believe me I&#39;m a model&quot;</b><br><br><b>Earth is flat , trust me I live there.</b>",1
3790,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So how do you define beauty and ugly ..you can&#39;t I think it just law of  attraction,1
3791,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She shouldn&#39;t be so apologetic. People don&#39;t want her to feel sorry for them and that breeds contempt more than anything else is when you pat someone on the head feeling sorry. You&#39;re blessed with looks? Then stop apologizing for all the social justice warriors that can&#39;t even screw in a light bulb. They&#39;re losers because they choose to be losers who don&#39;t like to compete. But she&#39;s a pretty young woman who feels compassion....,1
3792,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The thing is she&#39;s not that good looking,1
3793,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t see the appeal. She looks quite average.,1
3794,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is saying, because looks are not everything, and  even though she has trafficked her whole career based on her looks, she has depth of insight, knowledge, and most importantly wisdom, that you will likely overlook like all the other shallow people  have  if you are captivated  only by her looks..",1
3795,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i just cam e here to see the dislike ratio,1
3796,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"SI si, el aspecto no es todo. Por eso me he tragado tu TEDX de principio a fin. Igual que lo han hecho todos (unos por icono a emular, y otros pa relajar la vista).<br><br>Vasta ya de condenar la Belleza !!!!<br><br>Si lo que quieres decir es que las mujeres que poseen belleza, son humanas y no quieren que se les aprecie solo por ello ---&gt; estoy deacuerdo.<br><br>Pero tienes un trabajo bien remunerado, y eso se lo debes a tu belleza. No hay que confundir el hecho de que una mujer guapa desee algo ms que ser admirada por su belleza, con el hecho de despreciar la belleza.<br><br>Viva las mujeres guapas !!!! , y que se mueran las envidiosas, aunque eso me J_da porque soy Calvo, llevo un parche en el Ojo y encima la Pata de palo se me atasca en las Alcantarillas.",1
3797,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great talk. Wish it was longer,1
3798,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Don&#39;t do that. Don&#39;t give me hope.,1
3799,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yet another man pretending to be a real women <br><br>Telling me to arch my back?!! Yeah cos you dont have a natural arch!,1
3800,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,white woman privilege at its finest ,1
3801,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Believe me, I&#39;m a model. I use that line during most arguments.",1

3803,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Honestly the comments are making me think most people didnt even watch the whole video,1
3804,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i believe u but now marry me,1
3805,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah. Right,1
3806,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"For those who judged it for sounding like pure irony: What she&#39;s saying is no different from if you had a job that paid well, but it didn&#39;t fulfill you or help you grow as a person. You could have everything you wanted and still feel like there&#39;s a part of you that is missing, you obtained all these great superficial gifts, but haven&#39;t learned to love being alone with yourself with nothing outside of you to make you happy. Also, being pretty can complicate peoples&#39; lives or even end them. Sexual harassment, molestation, targeted pretty women for murder, feeling like no one will ever listen to what you say b/c they don&#39;t care as long as you&#39;re their eye candy. Loneliness, losing friends b/c you&#39;re &quot;stealing&quot; their bf or gf. Everyone has their own side to tell, and she was brave to share hers.",1

3811,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The fact that a person is born with a particular (ostensible) advantage does not mean that they are in some general way &quot;advantaged.&quot;  When you look closely at people&#39;s lives you will almost always find there some advantages and some disadvantages.  The &quot;advantage&quot; narrative is a false narrative.  In fact it is little better than an excuse.   And counter-intuitively, the ostensible advantage is very frequently its own disadvantage as well.  For example, the son of a billionaire will never be able to take satisfaction in being self-made or even in succeeding at anything.   Think that motivates?",1
3812,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The title&#39;s misleading. She&#39;s acknowledging how much looks affect our lives, while recognizing that the way you look is completely superficial. The whole talk is her explaining how good looking people are born with the deck stacked in their favor, and how she benefits from that. Also, this video is less a philosophical look into how we value looks than it is a deeper look into the politics of modelling.",1
3813,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not true. It&#39;s all about looks.,1
3814,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She spoke about how modeling made her insecure and unhappy, yet 7 years later today she is still modeling. It clearly isn&#39;t that bad, and if it is, she&#39;s setting a bad example by continuing on a self destructive path.",1

3825,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow people in the comments actually are all great speakers and writers!,1
3826,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No matter how much you want to change things, you can&#39;t change human nature. We are drawn towards beauty and we are a visual species, we like what looks good and avoid what looks bad. That goes back to our ancestors. You are drawn to beautiful people because your genes are telling you that person is going to help you create a good looking offspring that will prosper in life. That&#39;s just how things work and it won&#39;t change.",1

3832,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If I could condense her message, I would say that your success depends on where you put your time. As a result of her privilege from being attractive, she has put her time into modeling, a &quot;career&quot; path with a due date on earning capability. She feels that there are moments where she regrets putting the last 10 years into modelling, and while she recognises it is a privilege, she also recognises that the youth of today can achieve so much more with bigger aspirations. She wants us to know looks do not limit our potential. It might make it harder but it does not limit it, and that she concludes she does not recommend modelling as a career.",1

And she&#39;s saying that her type of genetic lottery is highly valued in this culture. Who she desires as  mates is a combination of cultural bias, genetics and upbringing, and I don&#39;t think she denied these things, nor did she imply that she was open to hook up with ugly men based on her moral convictions.",1

3849,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I believe her. I met a girl, who was a model for a short time, around a year or so. She resigned as she couldn&#39;t stand unhealthy competition, felt bad about herself, and was feeling very lonely. Everything that Cameron says here is what i&#39;ve heard from that girl plus a lot more sad stories. Apparently modeling world is very lonely place, where you have no friends at all. Also girls/women there are totally insecure, which to me is a parodox. Its a paradox of beautifull woman. Remember stories of Marylin Monroe or Grace Kelly. An exeptionaly beautiful women, who were sad an alone, and whose lives ended tragically. Please don&#39;t ridicule Cameron Russell, you miss the point anyway.",1

She overlooks at these minorities in these big cities of the ones committing the vast majority of the crime. She overlooks that most men time to fight white woman to be the most attractive women no matter what race those men are. That&#39;s not because of any alleged &quot;programming&quot; like she suggests, it&#39;s just their natural preference.  That&#39;s why you see successful black men almost always have white wives or girlfriends while white men almost never have black wives or girlfriends.  None of this is oppression or programming, it&#39;s just basic preference. none of us are programmed to think that clear skin Looks better than skin full of warts, it&#39;s just a basic preference we tend to naturally have. Notice that she didn&#39;t complain about a lack of older women in the modeling industry. <br><br> These TED Talks also promote homosexuality and selectively choose their speakers accordingly. They definitely have a political agenda.",1

Maybe fashion shows just also happen to be a white culture, more specifically Italian and French companies?

The problem is you think, people of other cultures actually care about white culture...They don&#39;t. Just like I don&#39;t give a .....about you or this talk. My preference is a smart woman who has a degree and is doing well in her field of work or research. That&#39;s what I would want for my child, not to walk on a ramp (Those are not great aspirations).

3875,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,xD i have no idea how smart you are....but you are damn Hot :D,1
3876,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Funny how its always the people who are amazingly attractive who say looks don&#39;t matter or its the millionaire with no financial worries who says money isn&#39;t everything. Of course they would say that, they have it.",1

3878,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,At least where ever you go everyone doesn&#39;t laugh at your big forehead and ugly face.,1
3879,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Some commenters seem to be willfully missing the point. She never said looks &quot;don&#39;t matter,&quot; in fact she clearly shows how they do matter. She talks about all the benefits she&#39;s received from society because of her looks, and how others are hurt by exclusive western ideals of beauty. But also how looks aren&#39;t &quot;everything&quot; -- that&#39;s the point when she asked girls to be her boss instead.",1

3896,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m really starting to hate good looking peoples specifically the beautiful girls.. I personally never believed that looks matter cause I never faced any problem in my life while applying for a job or dating a lady or fighting with cops for my rights and so on. I thought all these things worked for me because  I am a good and hardworking person. But today I&#39;m sure all these privileges I&#39;ve got isn&#39;t because of how am I as a person but because I look decent. Today my GF came back home crying cause she couldn&#39;t make it for the job 4th time in a row and I know it isn&#39;t her fault cause I prepared her for all those interviews and I know how good she is. It feels so bad when I see her upset and rejected when her friends got selected without any technical knowledge and 0 performance. I admit she is an average looking woman but she&#39;s a beautiful person with qualities but yeah who cares jobs are only for those pretty bitches who don&#39;t even have any idea about those jobs. Corporate world sucks and yes yes yes I would say it 100 times &quot;yes look doesn&#39;t matters for good looking peoples&quot;. Life is unfair for average looking peoples.,1
3897,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I bet she has never slept with a ugly man.  Looks aren&#39;t everything!  Rubbish.  Next ted talk I think...,1
3898,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Big is beautiful, I&#39;m sorry, but many men love seeing more meat on a woman. Society though in general is judgmental and the majority of us men are silent. One day we will rise.<br>However, as the saying goes &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&quot;.",1
3899,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Love it! Keep up the great work!,1

3903,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks &amp; money not everything said the beaytiful rich person.,1
3904,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I thought this talk was amazing. I have always aspired to look like models in vogue, and victoria secret models, and thought that if I could only look like that I would be happy. The &#39;real&#39; pictures of you helped me gain perspective, I&#39;ve watched this talk multiple times and its always made me feel better, like I had a clearer perspective on the world. Thank you.",1
3905,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ok. You have been benefitiated all your life...and everyone knows that. Where is the solution? To say that this is gender oppression???? Really???? Opportunities must be for everyone. No victimism.,1
3906,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very well spoken,1
3907,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I dont think no of you people understood her. What shes trying to tell you is that  Im white, tall and blonde and Im beautiful than you guys thats it. The rest of the people are accidentally born in this world",1
3908,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What I got out of this talk: people judge too quick based on looks. Based on looks, they think white skinny people are &quot;better&quot; than black ones for examle. That&#39;s not true, there is no logical connection between the two. So please try to stop doing that",1
3909,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Whos life is complete on this planet anyways?!?...,1
3910,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,THis ted talk is just stupid.... how many times can she mention race? What does have to do with the topic?<br><br>Waste of time,1

3914,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Models are insecure.What about normal everyday people who admire models?,1
3915,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The Wall defeats them all,1

3917,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,98% of this talk: &quot;I&#39;m not gonna lie my looks gave me all this awesome stuff that most people don&#39;t get&quot;<br>last 2% of the talk: &quot;Actually I&#39;m insecure&quot; <br><br>Then everybody clapped...,1
3918,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<b>Money is not all. Believe, i&#39;m rich.</b>",1
3919,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People should believe it when good looking people say that looks aren&#39;t everything. Most of them say that out of their personal experience. But all they think is that &quot;Yeah ofc you will say that. You&#39;re good looking. People don&#39;t call you ugly.&quot; We&#39;re born in a very judgemental society where most people don&#39;t care for how the other person will feel cuz of their comments. They think they&#39;re superior n have a right to comment on their looks when they don&#39;t.<br>No child is born ugly. All of them are born beautiful n lovable.,1
3920,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is fucking stupid. &quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything. Believe me, im a model&quot; is the equivalent to a billionaire saying &quot;Money isn&#39;t everything you poor fucks&quot;",1

3927,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You know, people wouldn&#39;t be so angry about this if they only had a speaker who&#39;s average looking too so atleast that person would truly know the struggles and pain that comes along with being ugly. Not be crass about her but when she speaks there she only looks like she&#39;s complaining a lot and being ungrateful. I&#39;m a psychology major and it&#39;s natural for people to feel mad or sad about this when they feel unrepresented enough. It&#39;s like she&#39;s saying i have tons of money and it&#39;s hard while the poor people are like, I&#39;ll take that!",1
3928,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks dont matter just like money dose not buy happiness. but they sure do help and make life alot easy&#39;r.,1

3935,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are the reason you do your best to make the best version of your life.,1

3938,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks do matter unfortunately. The world today is very vain.<br>Edit: she is right. Looks don&#39;t get you everything or fulfillment. Money doesn&#39;t complete life as well. You can have both and be miserable. Then on top of that because of what you have everyone thinks you have no right to be miserable.,1
3939,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,In a world without mirrors everybody is a model lol.,1
3940,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Title sounds like a logical fallacy. appeal to authority maybe?,1

3948,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lmao title xd,1
3949,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What an excellent speech!!!,1
3950,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is a totally pointless talk. If you found it insightful then you are either a child or a moron.,1
3951,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"See I told this to everyone..looks doesn&#39;t matter..at all..we all are super model in own shape and size.. see to be frank I don&#39;t like skinny..fig grl. But overweight and obesity causes lots of health issues, and individual should need to take  care and worried about this..not about 26 waist line. Yeah that&#39;s all and that&#39;s it..whether we are tall or short,whether we are black or white..all mother carry us equally 9 months in their womb. So cheer up ladies.. always keep bright smile on face..be confident how you are. And you know what..Men prefer wise and talent ladies not 36/26/36.",1
3952,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Did you ever notice that the only people saying &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; are good looking, and the only people that say &quot;money doesn&#39;t matter&quot; are people with money. Even if you agree that money can&#39;t buy happiness, you have to admit it can lease it for quite awhile.",1
3953,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There is a reason people who are physically less attractive struggle when it comes to dating; it is because they are filled with self pity, jealousy, bitterness and entitlement, all of which are extremely unattractive traits.  And because of their overall mentality, they make no effort to improve the parts of themselves that they have control over, and instead give up at the first hurdle, which pretty much makes them losers hiding behind excuses (such as losing the genetic lottery etc).<br><br><br>On the other hand, those people who take charge of their lives, and focus on improving every aspect of their attractiveness that they have control over, will often find it easy to attract partners.  When you develop your confidence and self esteem, and the personality traits that are attractive, you will significantly increase your value.  No one wants to go out with a loser who is filled with self pity and complains all the time, but we do find winners attractive, those people who are genuinely happy and positive, and couldn&#39;t care less how they compare to other people.<br><br><br>Put simply, there are plenty of changes that most people can make to increase their attractiveness, but until they past their loser mentality (and all of the negative, unattractive traits that come with it), they will never be attractive, and as a result they will never be happy.  And the longer you wait until you start making the changes, the more of your best years you will waste feeling sorry for yourself.  Just because you weren&#39;t born with a perfect face, doesn&#39;t mean you are a loser, but if you let your imperfect face be your excuse, then you will behave like a loser, and other people will view you as a loser.",1
3954,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I watched this only because she was beautiful,1
3955,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"its all about being healthy, fit and hygienic.<br>Attraction is when someone has true feelings for someone who looks like they will breed healthy children with you.",1
3956,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Breathing so gah damn hard,1
3957,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I came from a family of models. I am 5&#39;11 myself and growing up I got made fun of for my height and weight for being so skinny.  I was bullied. It was horrible.,1
3958,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;d bet she wouldn&#39;t go out with me once she got a look at me...,1
3959,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wonder how many views this would get if it just said Looks aren&#39;t everything......Believe me. Fact: many people just watched this on mute. Height doesn&#39;t matter believe me I&#39;m a Filipino.,1

3966,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The privilege and white guilts is strong in this womens.,1
3967,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Instead of saying looks don&#39;t matter or looks aren&#39;t everything people should say &quot;looks shouldn&#39;t matter&quot; and &#39;looks shouldn&#39;t be everything&quot;,1
3968,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Try never ever being a model and then coming out with this statement.,1
3969,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You basically say, that we admit feminity on females, thanks god we do. Then you say, that your photographer suck a lot, and is enjoying you acting like a stupid... If you would give young girls photoshop classes, you&#39;ll make much more than here.",1

3971,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"How great would it be if people like Camron were less self loathing and used their agency to help white young girls who are many, many, many more times likely to be raped by black and Latino men whom she cares so badly for that they may be pulled over for having weed in the car. <br><br>Its funny how whites are the only ones concerned about legacies of racial and gender oppression while others use it to their advantage. <br><br>Cameron does empower her own people, who need her so much. She allows herself to be a floor mat for those who are actually using their agency to help their own.",1

3975,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,oh well overall looks do matter cameron woulkd never want to look ugly but she is lucky she has a nice nose,1
3976,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"that is not  a case, her looking might be impressive but the speech is defenetly not, Unfortunately, not all pretty women or handsome men are intelegent enough to tell something meaningfull. What she told doesnt make a sense at all.",1
3977,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She made some great points. But she doesnt seem to recognize how beauty standards are changing with the shift in  demographics. People of color are now the majority, at least in America, and that has become prevalent in our media. Growing up, brown skinned curly haired girls like me were always type cast as the BFF of the blonde pretty love interest. Now she is the love interest. It is so interesting how much cultural standards of beauty have changed in the last 20 years. Even models of varieties of skin colors and body types have emerged. I appreciated her perception and speaking her truth, just wish she had acknowledged the progress the industry has and is making.",1

4010,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you been waiting a long time for this.,1
4011,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,An ugly person saying that statement would be believable. You saying it doesnt give it credibility or value.,1

4019,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything. Which is why a lot of women find it hard to keep a man.,1
4020,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She should not apologize for being pretty or white!! She was born with certain genes and white privilege is a meth! Put your best foot forward and live right and it will go better for you. Life is not always fair and you reap what you sow!!!!,1
4021,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If she grew up the ugly duckling then she would have both perspectives to judge and she would have insight into the transition. Just like a person who says money is not everything can tell you if they were rich who became broke or broke and became rich. She has one perspective only which is already bias so everyone has a point in ignoring everything she has to say.,1
4022,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Were still a bit mad shes rich because she was born pretty. And its not even that she was born pretty its just than she matches a pre set stereotype.,1
4023,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So sick and tired of this video coming up in the suggested list for the last 6 years. Go away now!,1
4024,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s right, when I turned 15 I was getting hit on and flirted on by girls like I was brad pitt or channing tatum this has continued for the most part for 30 years and the entire time..I&#39;ve been insecure about how I look. The reason is basically what she said but more specific is I&#39;m so used to being judged by the way I look and treated a certain way based from it that I&#39;ve somehow got so hyper focused on it that I scrutinize every detail of my appearance to the point I see every single flaw and that is almost all I personally see. So much so that when women flirt with me I&#39;m thinking ..really? surely they are just trying to make me feel better..anything other than I&#39;m actually good looking. I also think things like, well if they seen more of me they would think different. So yeah, looks are definitely not everything and in some cases it can be a curse. You may think, well I bet you have a great social life..nope. married once for a short time when I was in my 20&#39;s,  a handful of girlfriends over the years but been single now for 20 years with an occasional hookup... as bad as that sounds but its the truth. As I&#39;m getting close to 50 now I am becoming more relaxed and accepting the aging process so maybe my happiest years are yet ahead..at least that is the hope.",1

4029,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Right. Looks don&#39;t matter. The only thing that matters is pleasure right. That&#39;s kinda what she said and how you look at things in &quot;different lights&quot; can make a &quot;real&quot; difference and how you perceive them. But much like worthlessness, pleasure is absolute. And the day we can live without the need to feel good or the need to run away from pain is the day looks will actually not matter... because the world will be enlightened... or dust",1

4047,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Im a Christian and thats exactly how I dress. I hate it but Im forced by my mom,1
4048,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love her honesty....it was by far the most modest... most people with privileges don&#39;t acknowledge their privileges and group or gravitate with other individuals who do the same and look down on those without any of such kind. She sees those with disadvantages. And shows no favoritism and partiality.,1
4049,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is talking about acknowledging our own privileges. The mere fortune it seems that some by chance to be born more of the archetype of what is &quot;good&quot; in societal demands and standards; the more kinder, considerate, mercy we receive from favorable or unfavorable consequences of life. Society constructs &quot;The perfect image&quot; that are unrealistic in real life. I wish she would of made mention of how the earth can take advantage/ abuse &quot;beauty&quot; and can try to amass by greed its nature. Models are usually pressured to find unhealthy ways to stay super thin; and how they are disposed of after their youth seems to fade of.... she mentioned whiteness several times but I take that is not one of that main points onlookers got. Femininity in this world is classified as white, delicate is classified as thin (no muscle), graceful is classified as tall.",1

4051,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;d rather be good looking and depressed than average looking and depressed&#39;,1
4052,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Breaking the stereotypes.. <br>Wonderful. Id like to see her talk more about this. I think her hearts in the right place and yeah sure no matter what some people wont take it the right way. <br>But shes doing the right thing.,1
4053,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Who cares what a rich model has to say. So stupid and why did this show up as a recommendation to watch?,1
4054,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Such a great talk, thank you.",1
4055,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks matter when the person you like does not like you back: looks doesnt matter when someone you like likes you back.,1
4056,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Im gonna be completely honest right now. I feel........conflicted. There is a pert of me thats like what would she know? Shes beautiful and she wont know what its like to look ugly while the other part of me is like she does present some valid points and since she is pretty she would know best if looks arent everything. My more emotional and erratic part of the brain wants to dismiss her since she appeared to be patronizing all the while the more logical and intellectual part of my brain sees the merit in her statement and is showing me that it would be hypocritical to dismiss her because of her looks.<br><br>If anyone is to blame its the person who wrote the title. This is more of a message to pretty people and jealous woman then ugly people.,1
4057,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good looks aren&#39;t everything. You know what is <br><br><br><br><br>Intellect,1
4058,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So...a bunch of people didn&#39;t listen play the video, but are commenting based on the title. Nice.",1

4062,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"For everyone saying you are missing the point and then following up with discussing her points in regards to looks... that is also missing the point. This talk was unpacking the genetic lottery that perpetuates systematic oppression. She was utilizing her &#39;privilege&#39; and &#39;advantages&#39; to showcase what it looks like to be benefitting from a system that favors white people. I am white, and I find that too many people are uncomfortable to admit that they have reaped rewards by simply being white. This is why the racial discrepancies in our political climate are still so strained and tense, because white people get pissed if they are told that they are naturally benefitting off of systematic oppression. This discomfort shuts down any chance for a real discussion for change, and looking at the comment section there are too many people who are quick to insult the speaker than consider what the speaker has just done: showcasing the actual problems facing this country when it comes to the genetic lottery.",1

4065,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s easy to not stress about your looks...when you have them!  I&#39;d like to see an ugly Betty talk about how to not worry about your looks.,1
4066,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Must watch by every single girl like me who thinks only beautiful girls can have every joy in their life as time passes  ....and thinking girls like me don&#39;t even exists in this world,1

4068,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The reason why so many models are not women of color?   Light physics.  <br>The darker something is, the less light it reflects.  Thus, the less detail is shown.   Now apply that to people.  If you have a dark skinned model and  you have to use more light in order to bring out their features, then you end up washing out the lighter colors of whatever they may be wearing.  It&#39;s just light physics.  And, if it&#39;s supposed to be about the clothes, why do they even use &quot;pretty&quot; models in the first place?  Stick someone in one of those morph suit things and dress them.  Let them walk the runway like that.",1
4069,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,All ugly people have started their life on hard mode.,1
4070,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So you&#39;re saying it caused self-consciousness (less able to be spontaneous and just living).<br>That&#39;s also why females should not be told they are beautiful.<br>You mean well, but that declares (and her heart hears): I am judging you.",1
4071,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s sad that she was invited to speak at TED and nobody saw a problem. She is not sophisticated/mature enough to speak comfortably to strangers. Remember when you&#39;re young and you speak just to express your feelings, rather than to influence the listeners. She&#39;s like that. She will feel embarrassed when she grow up one day and look at this video of herself. I&#39;m not questioning her because everyone has been there before, but it&#39;s wrong for the TED people to support/encourageher in doing this.",1

Stop invalidating people for their mistakes, especially when theyre trying to not let others fall down the same trap theyre in.",1
4075,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This reminds me of how sometimes we rush into relationships based on looks, and it ends up falling apart. I also felt pretty uncomfortable when she spoke of being hyper-sexualized during the shoot by the photographers while she was underage and never had a boyfriend.",1

4084,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Please. She is so virtuous.

She is basically saying we might not have the same struggles but we all deal with the same amount of struggle <br>Everyones heart looks the same and thats where it counts!",1

She can easily say looks aren&#39;t everything since she&#39;s got MOSTLY everything she&#39;s ever wanted and getting to where she is now by looking that way. Would love to see a NORMAL looking bloke make it and make a speech like this. It would be much more interesting.

4187,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t say this from what I have witnessed I&#39;m 74 I have never really seen a I have never really seen a model that I thought  was really pretty and the reason I say this is because makeup is an illusion and we know that hairstyles are an illusion wigs hair pieces Toppers extensions and without that I mean who are you and I have seen some women if they wore makeup it took away from their looks and that is just the way it is and like Gina a Gigi Bella I don&#39;t think that they&#39;re really pretty it is their lifestyle and that&#39;s where they come from in my money has bought them what they wanted do they have to do a little work and yeah they did but it was for named and they got their payoff but they&#39;re not pretty not to me. I think Cindy Crawford&#39;s very pretty but even she made the same that she wished she look like Cindy Crawford so she knows better than anyone that&#39;s my take on the modeling world you have to be tall and skinny and they do the rest of makeup and wigs and it&#39;s not what you know it&#39;s who you know it still stands true to be so today what about that<br>Lights camera action,1

4275,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,just f*ck off you have so many things you dont know about people who should work so hard to win 1/100 of amount you win,1
4276,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Remember guys we are all gonna die  looks are temporary,1
4277,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you!,1
4278,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"After what I&#39;ve noticed in today&#39;s class, i guarantee that looks are really everything...when the prettiest girl and boy present their works, everyone is paying attention and preising them..but when the &quot;ugly&quot; ones are talking, everyone is sleeping, then you get a bad grade and the teacher tells you that you made your classmates bored and uninterested...i cried a lot today",1
4279,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"looks arent everything, true, but they are something, that&#39;s for sure",1
4280,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good looking people always say that &#39;looks isnt everything&#39; but there arent any ugly person who says that. I wonder why? Its simple calculus,1
4281,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But isnt easy to be a ugly,1
4282,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The ugliest thing is jealousy, and attractive people have to deal with that every day, and it&#39;s not pretty.",1
4283,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Explains why my life sucks balls.....,1
4284,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I can only imagine for those that don&#39;t have looks going for them in this picture perfect times we are in.,1
4285,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No they&#39;re not...FIGHT LIKE A GIRL!!! Start a revolution and vote Donald Trump out now, register to vote!!!Parents are burying their children prematurely and children are burying their parents prematurely from cancer. Hello America!<br><br> We have the power to make the CHANGE. Those who have protested around there U.S. and the world need to vote this president OUT behind him rolling back the protection we had to protect our CLIMATE.<br><br> Electoral should be abolished, it&#39;s flawed. <br>Have this clown turn over his taxes. <br>No more Trump next year people. Have him show his taxes and get out of office. So we can say  bye Felicia!!! To Donald Trump. <br>The future can&#39;t afford to keep Donald around. <br>Climate change? Donald obviously knows nothing about it and we can&#39;t afford to have him roll back policies that would help us with our deteriorating climate. <br> Every young American MUST go out and vote!!!!! Go register NOW! Trump ROLLED BACK ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS BECAUSE HE DOESN&#39;T CARE ABOUT OUR FUTURE &amp; THE FUTURE OF THE YOUTH. LET HIM KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM NOT CARING ABOUT OUR EARTH/ENVIRONMENT OR THE YOUNG PEOPLE&#39;S FUTURE. WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE OUR FUTURE BY VOTING FOR SOMEONE WHO CARES ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING!<br> Trump&#39;s for the rich. LISTEN WELL PEOPLE. He doesn&#39;t doesnt care for the poor and middle class of this country. Help Trump find a new address and vote for whoever wins the primary other than Trump. They are changing  the laws for the rich to take advantage of the poor in the workplace and to change the tax laws to  to raise taxes for the poor and middle  class besides the RICH. EXAMPLE: As in the gig economy, As in Uber. We aren&#39;t able to sue the rich companies like Uber. Uber&#39;s new disclosures policies PROHIBIT drivers from suing Uber for Missclassifying drivers, failure to pay overtime for YEARS and not giving thier drivers tips by advertising &quot;tips are included&quot;. The rich and wealthy are being allowed to break the Labor Laws that have been in place for years! Whoever heard of this? They are trying to get rid of the construction and old labor LAWS!!<br>Liar&#39;s!! Stop opiate consumption because it only profits the FDA, BIG PHARMA and  hospitals...again the rich are taking advantage of the poor and middle class. Its the leading cause of death today and you young people are falling for it and allowing them to fry your brains with drugs. That&#39;s how they control the General population today. It is profiting the wealthy and causing a drastic homeless Holocaust just to profit the rich. Look at the state of this country!!! They just caught a ship with drugs on it, Trump was saying Mexicans are bring drugs from Mexico, can an attorney check into weather or not JP Morgan who was found to be affiliated with this ship full of drugs. It was 1 ton of cocaine! Please! have an attorneys get a hold of this information to see if they&#39;re going to prosecute whoever was involved in bringing these drugs into this country on this ship so we can prove that we are locking up the poor who bring some drugs to this country yet they don&#39;t prosecute the wealthy who bring tons of drugs into this country.<br> The WEALTHY are not paying their fair share of taxes and our war torn streets scream loud and clear that rich aren&#39;t paying enough taxes.  Donald is rich and he is for the RICH ..do you think he is for the poor or middle class? <br>Get out and vote: Democrates, otherwise WE WILL GET STUCK WITH TRUMP AGAIN IF WE ALL DONT VOTE FOR THE winning PRIMARY candidate.  (WE CANT AFFORD TO VOTE FOR AND independent because it will take votes away from the Democratic party and Trump&#39;s SCUNK again. WE WILL GET STUCK WITH THIS JOKER AGAIN. <br> Stop fracking and geoengineering clouds now. Stop these refineries, Trump is for the Rich coal miners that ruin our Earth.The United States is burning up and you say there is no evidence of what Greta is talking about. Changing a light bulb!? Really! get out if your own way of your own ignorance and research just on the weekend you&#39;d be floored as to what&#39;s really going on with these fake smog in the air. Fake clouds, fake mist in these sprinkle that they are sprinkling us with today.Those fake rains are toxic for us. Wear hoodies and use umbrellas no matter how light the rain might be, these acid rain clouds are toxic for us and I believe are the cause of cancer and other illnesses today. <br>Look up the YouTube video of a scientist who has been recording the North Pole ice caps melting for 35 years from a glacier down to an ice cube and down to nothing. The United States of America and the world is flooding. YouTube it. People from around the U.S. and the world are recording it and posting it. <br>Look up the lawsuits around the world that common folks are starting to sue th companies that PROFIT from creating these clouds. YouTube: &quot; We are suing these B@stards&quot; it is not misspelled. You&#39;ll see that common folk are suing, thank God people are fighting back. YouTube video from &quot;Anonymous&quot; on these fake clouds. They say they are controlling the weather, really! Well we can PROVE we we&#39;re fine before geoengineered clouds, stop your lies. Look at these fires alone, they are creating mass destruction due to their GREED.  <br>I know a lot because I am a cancer survivor. I beat cancer naturally (including 3 blood transfusion). I studied cancer for 5 years and eventually beat it. Thank God. <br>I know what I know by default because I wanted to live and not do Chemotherapy and managed to survive. <br>I know that they have the cure for most cancers in 45 days but the FDA won&#39;t approve it because they SAY THEY WANT MORE TRIALS, MEANWHILE people are dying like flies from cancer. Do you know what a 45 day cure would have done for me? I wouldn&#39;t have lost almost 12 years of my life trying to cure myself and recoup from being sick for 7 years with cancer. I wouldn&#39;t have lost my house and my successful trucking business. Look up the &quot;Vice&quot; show &quot; the new cancer cure&quot; something a long that title. They show a man who has stage 4 brain Cancer- and get rid of it within 45 days. Brain Cancer- is one of the hardest Cancers because the Brain is on a different lymphatic system than the rest of our body. John McCain died of brain Cancer- served our country and not even he wasn&#39;t privy to the stem cell cure, not even on a trail basis. Wouldn&#39;t you be mad if you or a loved one had cancer and was dying and you KNEW there was an easier way or a less TOXIC way to curing cancer than going the chemotherapy route which is a horrendous route to take. Yet the FDA APPROVES TOXIC CHEMICALS IN OUR FOOD AND YET ALL WE TALK ABOUT ON THE NEWS IS FAKE NEWS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP...SHAME ON ALL YOU AMERICANS WHO ARE SLEEPING. WATCHING A STRAIGHT UP PUPPET SHOW AND WE ARE ALL TOO OLD FOR IT, YET THAT&#39;S WHAT YOU ALL ARE DOING. I&#39;ve been told that the clouds have the same compound of Agent Orange. The same thing they sprayed in the Vietnam War. Someone needs to test the sit on our cars and are blood ample to compare the compound. Get the Lawsuit against the federal government in the Vietnam war.  MEANWHILE WE ARE LIGHTING UP LIKE A MATCH!! and all everyone want to do is be on social or watch fake news. <br>There&#39;s a lot of ways to make a difference rather than posting here on things you know nothing about. I&#39;m an older woman and I fight for my children, my grandchildren and the young people who are dying with cancer in unprecedented numbers. I fight the Medical system that pumping opiates to the AMERICAN public for injuries,  depression, someone going through a divorce or something (when years ago the doctors prescribed counselors and Psychotherapy of some kind and not opiates) for attention span deficit disorder they prescribe Ritalin  (look up the side affects of that on a child). My daughter when she was 10 years old was  recommended that by the psychologist and her teacher in her elementary school and I refused. I was 28 years old at the time and I laughed and said &quot;absolutely not&quot;!!! I told them &quot; you aren&#39;t getting my daughter on drugs cuz you have too many kids. They said my daughter isn&#39;t focused and she gets off her seat and visits her classmates. I told them my daughter is a social butterfly and I will talk to her about  that but you aren&#39;t drugging up my daughter and turning her into a zombie cuz you can&#39;t handle your class. Today my daughter owns a successful Beauty salon in Los Angeles and If I would have listen to them my daughter would be strung out on drugs or Dead by an overdose. She is 40 years old now. <br>I&#39;m not asleep, never have been since I was a child. God has blessed me with knowledge and foresight on issues that affect us today. It is a gift and a blessing. <br>Wake up, before you are knee deep in the murky Waters or your house is on fire literally. Come on the Amazon Forrest is on fire and we can&#39;t afford for that to happen. <br>The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, we have got to try and stop the crooks from killing us and doing us in just for PROFIT. They are a bunch of old Crocks and on their way out. Watch the movie &quot;All the money in the world&quot; you&#39;ll understand the mindset of the rich sick old Crocks that would slice their own mother&#39;s throat for profit. Most of us all will live long enough to witness our own demise because you&#39;d rather be entertained by nonsense and fake news. Which is costing us millions of our tax dollars. <br>PLEASE vote for the winner in primary besides Trump otherwise we will get stuck with him again. He is for ONLY THE RICH TO PROFIT MORE. WAKE UP AMERICA your house is on fire. <br>Test the soot on our cars and get the Lawsuit AGAINST the AMERICAN Vietnam war vets against the Federal Government and compare what the sprayed on them to the soot on our cars, in our blood stream and sue them to stop this maddness crookery. STOP being entertained and do something!!!",1
4286,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a great message!,1
4287,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I use to model on a much smaller scale and it&#39;s so obvious how these companies are using and sexualizing young girls. Most models are underage but done up to look like adults; it&#39;s disgusting and terrible for these models.,1
4288,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Only got the views because of how you look. Looks do matter and thats a fact.,1
4289,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She said I benefit from the skinny white standard of beauty and I always have. Many people are treated  negatively based their physical appearance (specifically people of color). Yes I might be considered beautiful, but that is because I constantly worry about my appearance and won the genetic lottery. She did NOT say Im beautiful but looks arent everything! Yall need to use your fucking ears. She is unpacking the issue of racial and gender oppression and you all shut her down by ignoring her actual message",1
4290,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Im convinced 90% of the people commenting here didnt even watch the video and only got as far as the title. Yall are the reason theres a problem. Its pages and pages of the same comment over and over again. you arent as funny as you think you are,1
4291,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It seems that the majority of commenters have only read the title and not actually listened to the speech.,1
4292,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,One of my fav TED Talks!! Love her honesty!,1
4293,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you don&#39;t have to tell people that you are a model...definitely do not need to show a proof with a catwalk pic...we know that you are just by looking at you,1
4294,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Damn, its sad to see how everyone in the comments is missing the point...",1
4295,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This girl has beauty coming from within and they couldn&#39;t steal it/hijack it/dumb it down,1
4296,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ye s  &quot;constructions&quot; for the ones making money off of you !!!,1

4299,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I thought the title was sarcasm but oop- no, we really that pathetic",1
4300,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was so honest and brave of you to tackle such a sensitive and important topic. Very well done...thank you for that!!!,1
4301,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,these comments are filled with really insecure people,1

4304,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everybody listens to ugly people and beautiful people but nobody cares for average ones XD,1
4305,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,One of the most honest talks from any woman. I really started respecting her a lot because she admitted that hot women get an easy pass in life and it wasn&#39;t &quot;hard work and talent&quot;.,1
4306,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How impressive. <br>Yes it&#39;s absolutely true but for many people it might not be.,1
4307,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great points made. Yall taking this as an attack on unattractive people, she is actually sticking up for them!",1
4308,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Killstreaks arent everything - guy with an AC130,1
4309,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The first red talk with no content/meaning.,1
4310,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great presentation Cameron. Brave for bringing out injustices of looks and beauty vs real people who can be Golden on the inside regardless of how physically attractive they are.,1
4311,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks arent everything<br><br>- <b>top best looking people in the world</b>,1
4312,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;ve been reading these comments, and I&#39;m really sad seeing how some people are using their &quot; ugliness &quot; as an excuse for why they&#39;re treated terribly in life by others, and that &quot;pretty &quot; people are treated better than them. Funny thing is, I used to feel the same way. But then I realized if I can&#39;t change my appearance, I might as well change my attitude. After I started gaining confidence and smiling more often, I realized that not as many people were treating me like I was &quot;ugly&quot;, instead they were treating me with more kindness and being more welcoming. Of course, maybe they were already treating me with kindness, but I  just didn&#39;t see it, considering how much of my life I wasted wallowing in self-pity. If you take anything away from this comment, realize that if you have the time and energy to waste on being nothing but a pool of self-pity, anger, depression, sadness, and UGLINESS, then change yourself, your attitude, your way of thinking. Gain confidence, and SMILE :)",1
4313,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Go to a country in Africa and you will be the  minority while others benefit.,1
4314,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great. Loved your speech, lady!",1
4315,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ptn encore un titre en francais trompeur,1
4316,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oh god, its both, looks and personality, always<br>EQUALLY",1
4317,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Too many people are missing her point! The point is that there is more to life, as this model has found personally, than looks. Stop judging, start listening ",1
4318,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Huh this girl have me thinking about all the things that i wanted to be is a big fat lie only looks so good on tv , camera , social media.",1
4319,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Indeed just a model can say look doesn&#39;t matter. This video is pure garbage.,1
4320,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She seemed so nervous to have this hard discussion, but very brave. Wonderful message",1
4321,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It was an informative video,1
4322,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,people who has money like trump says money cant buy everthing <br>well it can buy weed hookers p*****s right thats enough,1
4323,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I bet you&#39;ll Never gunna see her fuckin an ugly dudes....her talk is still superficial.....did she ever turn down a check for whatever reason......if she is so concerned about looks....cut your hair off, tattoo your face, gain 50lbs. and go to work for minimum wage....otherwise she&#39;s another JAR.....Just Another Receptacle..and a hypocrite.",1
4324,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So intelligent. An honest revealing talk about white privilege and inheritance... I&#39;m very happily impressed.,1
4325,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Its funny, here I never thought about that. I was never a beauty and I always thought that I a  bit loser for not being. You know,  if you&#39;re a girl and you&#39;re not pretty, you&#39;re less girl. So they say;  Early in age, I had that feeling it may seem really sad, but I&#39;m not complaining, because as soon as you notice you can&#39;t weight your happiness in your appearance, you learn to have other passions. To like other stuff about yourself. And today i woke up a bit later, i just changed and went to work. I didn&#39;t make up, it didn&#39;t took hours to find a skirt. I just brushed my teeth, changed, and went out. How many pretty girls feel secure enough to do that. Since they&#39;re young, they learn they must look good. I did also, but since I wasn&#39;t a very pretty girl one way or another, i learnt ignore it. And seeing this girl, her income depends on her looks, isn&#39;t just a social pressure. She cant, like me, just wake up and go out. She cant weight up some kilos. She&#39;s somehow caged in that word of appearances and thats sad . Maybe have grown as the ugly chubby girl wasn&#39;t that bad. <br>Yeah she probably makes more money than me,  more followers and more guys, sure. But being me, is not as bad as I thought",1
4326,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The ironic thing is the only reason you expect anyone to believe you is.....because of your looks that allowed you to be a model. Don&#39;t think you know what you&#39;re talking about.,1
4327,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Attractiveness is a must.But I&#39;m pretty but it does nothing,1
4328,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,so grateful I am now able get my dream car thanks to <b>EZpay100 .c o m</b>,1

So what to do with that beautiful wife dnt knw how to treat husband...by the way who u are u are... Allah created the world nd knows better. Because 100 percent body working is a big gift...

4343,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"For me it is more of the men side. I am in college and there is more than 40,000 kids at my school. I have never dated because I am just indifferent about it. When I see an attrative guy or match with one or meet the guy in real life and he is an 8/10 that is when it gets hard. Even if he is not making me feel that way that is all I think about. The whole date, or even before knowing him. It is constantly on my mind I am a 6 on a good day and I am not skinny I think I am just right...right?...two things I always think to myself. Especially because I am not a constant gym goer. To me it is the worst environment to be in and I always hope I am alone when I am there. But these attartive fit dudes make you automatically think they only like skinny sorority girls who all look the same. I know thinner people still struggle soemtimes too but at the end of the day it is not the same to me. Or society. And that is a huge influence on everything. College is just not doing me well with confidence. I or anyone in general feels lesser when you have less money unlike a lot of these kids here who are rich their money or not. It is easy to say love yourself or just be confident and they won&#39;t care or you wouldn&#39;t want a guy like that anyways but why not? That means I have to settle for someone I don&#39;t find atttrative because it would be easier? but that&#39;s just not true.",1

4347,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hizo el esfuerzo!,1
4348,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The message that she was trying to say seemed to be a little compact and complex. She has the most perfect body and she is on stage saying most kids feel insecure of their bodies.

I&#39;m ugly so I would know&quot;.<br>Stop it.<br>Her point is that even if you WERE &quot;beautiful&quot; (which is a fabricated idea) you still wouldn&#39;t be happy. Models are insecure everyday. You might be insecure every day. She&#39;s not complaining about her looks, she&#39;s making a point about how those looks are portrayed and perceived. Cameron Russell won the &quot;gene lottery&quot; and so everyday people worship her (which she did nothing to deserve), and the people in the photo industry exploit her. Models have no rights, and being the subject in a completely staged photo doesn&#39;t give you confidence. It doesn&#39;t show any skill. But people hate on her if she says anything negative about her life because they STILL believe &quot;if only they were beautiful&quot;. How about &quot;if only I were confident&quot; or eventually &quot;I AM confident&quot;. Beauty doesn&#39;t ignite confidence all by itself.<br>I love this quote from Susan Tanner:<br>&quot;I remember well the insecurities I felt as a teenager with a bad case of acne. I tried to care for my skin properly. My parents helped me get medical attention. For years I even went without eating chocolate and all the greasy fast foods around which teens often socialize, but with no obvious healing consequences. It was difficult for me at that time to fully appreciate this body which was giving me so much grief. But my good mother taught me a higher law. Over and over she said to me, You must do everything you can to make your appearance pleasing, but the minute you walk out the door, forget yourself and start concentrating on others. &quot;<br>I love that. Let&#39;s forget ourselves and focus on our personality and education, and let&#39;s love others and not care about their appearance.",1
4374,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a model.&quot;<br><br>Yeeeeaaah... that would change instantly if I asked her out...",1
4375,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She perty..,1
4376,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I get what she says, but i have seen that beautiful people get all the privileges , opportunities, and the attention than the less than average looks person gets treated.  She can say what she wants and its valid. But its not the way society sees you or treats you depending on your looks. i am very good looking but sometimes purposely dress poorly and dont do my face or hair and when i go to a shop, i get served the last or they ask me to leave because they think i am a hobo. I am also judges by the color of my skin as well. then when i change my dressing the way i walk and look, boy do i get treated like a goddess. I laugh inside but then i am sad because thats proof to me how society or men even perceive beauty.  SO my friend , you meant well but society isnt ever going to change.",1
4377,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So?  what difference does it make that  4% were non-white?  Not a big difference to me.    And that test was done 6 years ago.        As of July 2016, White Americans are the racial majority. African Americans are the largest racial minority, comprising an estimated 12.7% of the population. Hispanic and Latino Americans are the largest ethnic minority, comprising an estimated 17.8% of the population.",1

4381,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She suffers greatly from white guilt.,1
4382,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One of the most amazing, yet hardest part about this industry is understanding your type, your body, your image. You often find yourself feeling average because there could be a thousand other girls/boys lined up to audition that look exactly like you. The hardest part is to overcome that you are beautiful despite having a similar body to a lot of people. The amazing part is that whether you get the role or not, it proves your individuality and beauty. By getting the role, it means your personality stood out compared to the thousands of other people who may look like you. If you didnt get the part, you may not be what they were looking for which means your personality is different then the girl/guy they choose. This to me shows that we are unique and our personality is more important than our image.",1

4388,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Been saying it for years. Genetics is the biggest scam. Can&#39;t feel sorry for anyone fortunate enough to be born attractive. No sympathy for attending attractive people. Everything is so much easier for those that fortunate. Must be nice,1

4404,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great. Thank you. And thank you for this lovely human presenting this talk.  I don&#39;t know who she is. How great people can be. Be like that.,1
4405,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just amazing. ,1
4406,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Do we associate a negative tone with negative connotations to certain words and a positive tone to positive connotations of words or do we just ignore the negative or positive completely based on how we already perceive that person?,1
4407,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,THANK YOU. YOUR HONESTY IS GOING TO HELP SO MANY YOUNG GIRLS WHO ARE SO NEGATIVE ABOUT THEMSELVES &amp; THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO BE PHYSICALLY PERFECT TO BE HAPPY. THIS SHOULD BE SHOWN BY EVERY PARENT OF THESE CHILDREN.,1

4409,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,BORING!!!,1
4410,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are everything believe me I&#39;m not beautiful,1
4411,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This seemed really pointless and self-indulgent to me.  Lady, your dress does not intimidate me.  Do you have something to say or not?",1
4412,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thank you for this talk. A breakdown of white privilledge from a white person, same things we&#39;ve been saying as back people but we only sound paranoid",1
4413,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Humble and confronting - this talk was done out of love and compassion for the less privileged, thank you for your empathy.",1
4414,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,make untertitles in German please!!,1
4415,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, supermodels are insecure about their looks, because it&#39;s their job. However  people that COULD be supermodels, yet pursue other enterprises are certainly some of the happiest people on earth. Here in Santa Barbara I&#39;m surrounded by them. LOL BTW, &quot;society&quot; didn&#39;t set the rules, invent and define what&#39;s attractive to people; nature did that for us. Society doesn&#39;t have the power to tell us what we find attractive; but it can refine and mass produce it.",1
4416,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I get her point was. At the end of the day, we will always be greedy, everything will never be enough for us even when we are already decent looking or even pretty. Though it is hard to grasp, even for me. I think we should atleast be grateful for what we already have.",1
4417,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So much virtue signal. Cant make it through.,1
4418,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It is easy to say that looks are not everything when you are a model. I wonder if this talk like this would be a more appropriate one: &quot;Looks is not everything. Believe me, I am the ugliest person in my town.&quot;",1
4419,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The comments on here alone are proving how badly physically attractive people get treated.,1
4420,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lets say the truth. Being beautiful or just standard but confident enough to look attractive does make a difference. You get more chances, you are more liked, you attract more people and are generally treated better. Trying to deny this doesnt make any sense and just makes me feel worse. Because no matter how this girl is open-minded, no matter how she understand that looks is not everything: looks will always impact my life. And she can allow herself to say these stuff because she is and is considered beautiful. But when you dont like yourself and have never feel loved... thats impossible.",1
4421,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its always the ugly girls that think theyre good looking. She doesnt even have a nice body.,1
4422,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks arent everything, what is beautiful is how much you feel empathy towards all the quirks in each and every other person around you and see each other person as cute to you.",1
4423,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I got a dress free, and police officers like me because of how I look,....but looks aren&#39;t everything?. I feel like she spent the whole time bragging on her looks and benefits of how she looks and reminds us of how she&#39;s a model...lol",1
4424,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not a picture of me but a construction was a very powerful statement... That was a cool talk, she struggles through it.",1
4425,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love you for speaking the truth  your work is powerful and influential for me personally and professionally.I&#39;ve been harrassed just for being pretty and also admired.I truly get looks are not everything at all.even if you are intelligent,you can be insulted by ppl who want to bully you ..it&#39;s not about looks or intelligence it&#39;s about attitudes and behaviours. If someone is judging you then it reflects them and their small minded fears and experience. Loving ourselves is our birthright no matter how we look or are ,we are each unique with are special gifts and talents that deserve to be seen heard and acknowledged and valued beyond this human condition and irritating personal preferences of some ppl.",1
4426,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Her talk is not that well structured. This is also why so many cant get the message right. She is trying to say 1. that looks is deceiving and not equal to happiness - so dont aspire to just having good looks/winning the lottery 2. but she is also mixing some society lashing into it, saying there is something off with the fact that she gets to have so many benefits as a white beautiful female, when others are having so many struggles.",1

4430,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I came into this life as a facially deformed &#39;defective&#39; person. I was told by the doctors that I looked like I got hit in the head by a Mac truck at age 14. Total confidence killer. This imaginary world of others and the thoughts that flow through may not perceive me as physically beautiful,.. but I have come to know that my body is an illusion as much as my identity story about myself. The truth is I am the Most Beautiful thing in this WHOLE world! Because I am the only thing that&#39;s Real. My Heart and my Soul. My Spirit. The essence of WHO I really am. And so are you. Our Spirit is the ONLY thing true. Everything else is a lie. Everything else is an illusion of what can NEVER Be REAL.",1

4439,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was the worst TED Talk I have listened to.,1
4440,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t get the point of people complaining about how they look and saying it matters a lot in their life. No one is unattractive, but plenty of people don&#39;t know how to make themselves more attractive. Your body won&#39;t look hot without practicing. Your skin won&#39;t look bright without your taking care of it. And it&#39;s not always about the pretty face you have on, but also about your professional and wise attitude you have towards your commitments at work or during personal life socializing. It&#39;s about your confidence and charisma. Those things won&#39;t just fall down from the sky. You have to gain it yourself through years of practice and experimenting.<br><br>Girls, if you aren&#39;t born with a privileged look, be knowledgable. Beauty won&#39;t last as long as your knowledge does.",1
4441,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Women have been the beneficiaries of their beauty since the beginning of time. She is beautiful and interesting and honest but she should not be so annoyingly apologetic about being white and pretty. Its a biological accident. Theres plenty of beautiful black models in America whove made millions and millions. Why doesnt she count the white models in Nigeria or Kenya ? Stop with the politics  its not becoming. <br>   By the way, I wonder what her boyfriend or girlfriend look like ?  Bet you theyre drop dead gorgeous.",1

4448,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"appreciate the honest talk! it speaks to the world we live in and yes, some people have an easier life , some don&quot;t, because of the way they are perceived, seen and the way they present themselves or it is all inherited from parents - genes or money. ultimately is up to you what you make of it.",1

4452,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People are talking about the importance of personality, but the thing is that even the personality could depend on the look. For instance, let&#39;s say that you have two persons one ugly and one good looking, the ugly person is treater worse than the good looking one since its very birth, and that will certainly affect its personality. I don&#39;t know any research about that, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if ugly people in general are more shy and less social and confident than good looking people, that got more positive feedback since their childhood and therefore are more confident",1
4453,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She talks just like Dr. Reid (Criminal Minds), half awkward, half genius, I think she&#39;s awesome! lol",1

4456,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Her point is that it doesn&#39;t matter how you look. You can be a model and still feel insecure about your looks. It is all percieved.,1

4464,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;d like to talk like her. About my self like she does herself. I could listen to her with ease. You Do Not Judge a Book By its Cover.we are all equal. In my mind.,1
4465,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks is everything in world better look beautiful and smart and handsome peoples get so much attention from everyone and average and bad looking guys and girls dont even get noticed...like they are nothing on this planet,1
4466,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oh my fucking god how long has the human species been alive and we just now are talking about that how women look isnt everything., what is happening on this planet",1
4467,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its so easy for white women to be considered beautiful. She doesnt look special at all. Nothing about her is beautiful to me. But.. shes white ,1
4468,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why didnt she talk about how few runway models were 96% or more white? That number is very low as well, another student did the research and found that there were only 66 model in that category, but I guess that didnt help her racist narrative.<br>Its a mathematical fallacy to compare 4% to 96% as she did.",1
4469,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Bullshit. At every single turn in your life youll have 50 people wanting to help you, some because youre pretty and people treat pretty people nicer. Some for sexual purposes or some just to be in your good books because who doesnt want to be seen with the stunner. This works particularly for women. Pretty women have almost everything on a plate and have had since the dawn of time.",1

I don&#39;t know how because  I&#39;m really insecure about how I look. I decided I might do this as a career but to me, I am ugly, compared to someone of the people on Instagram and people in my school. I get the feeling that I wanna be shown as beautiful and &#39;sexy&#39;. I&#39;m currently ill atm. People in my school usually have a new boyfriend every 2 weeks and it shouldn&#39;t make me jealous but it does, always dreamed of being in their place, being beautiful asf, but everything I do doesn&#39;t really convince anyone I&#39;m beautiful.",1

It&#39;s in the description for God&#39;s sake. What she&#39;s trying to say is that while not being &quot;pretty&quot; has its own many problems, there are new problems that arise when you <b>are</b> pretty. All these comments are just proving her point further, that people in society see being traditionally pretty as this cure all for all your problems. You&#39;re giving her crap for not knowing how it feels to be in your shoes when you haven&#39;t been in hers.",1

4493,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this comment section is very sad. people are getting thousands of likes for completely missing the point of the video. she is acknowledging the unfairness in society but pointing out that just because you won the genetic lottery, it does not make you happier mentally than the person who didn&#39;t.",1

4497,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She ain&#39;t all that. I&#39;ve banged way hotter. But thanks for telling us all how hot you think you are and that you feel privileged. Great speech,1
4498,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The irony in the title of a video that has 20 Million views, (one of the most viewd in TED) mostly I&#39;m sure, because of the thumbnail of an attractive woman.",1

4500,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she saying they matter too much and also not enough to make you happy alone. sge us using privilege to point out the flaws of our beauty system. I like her.,1
4501,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is brilliant.,1
4502,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Shes right, there are good looking people who are very insecure. I think especially women. <br>Having everyone fawn over you because of your looks is going to feed your ego, but theres always going to be someone whos more attractive than you. Lots of women cant handle that. Ive seen attractive women act so spiteful and jealous when theyre around another attractive woman.<br><br>I think looks can definitely make people treat you nicer and pay more attention to you, which is a shame. Its a double edged sword though. If youre exceptionally good looking youll probably get fairer treatment, but you also have to deal with jealously and lecherous people. And I feel like by virtue of being good looking, its easy to become obsessed with your looks which leads to a bad mental state.",1
4503,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I dated a model for a while.  I couldnt handle it.  I felt like I had to look better than my best all the time.  Most of that was on her because she was superficial.  Also on me though because I was only attracted to the physical part of her and she made me feel important.  Totally not worth it.,1
4504,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ok,1

I got pulled out of the security queue at airport and checked as a convict in front of everyone. I was made to place my hands on bars, part my legs and checked, asked to raise my feet to check under my sports shoes. If that wasn&#39;t enough another security lady with the same gloves she checked other ppl n stuff on airport put her used gloved hands to check in my panties, my jeans pockets n around my belly area. I had no belt, plain blue jeans n a white Tshirt. I was flying with my partner. My backpack was taken apart n they found nothing. Whereas all white travellers went past without being checked or touched. I wanted to say instead to the security woman to put me through the xray machine even my bag n shoes. They should get a sniffer dog too.<br>Why did they humilate me publicly? I saw the same being done with another young single Indian woman, same treatment but the white passengers walked past the security without any issues.

After the break up, she was hired at my job and I had to work with her and it hit me, it was never about her looks that made him fall for her. She had such a huge personality and so many friends that cared about her and life going on. And I was just dead lonely, with my thoughts and sadness. My social skills were so rusty because I was so depressed from the break up and I felt like I was not enough. I didnt deserve to be apart of anything. When people invited me to things I would spend hours stressing over what to wear and staring at my hair and then breaking down crying that I couldnt go. And I didnt know why I was like that because I knew I was prettier than most people yet I was scared of being hurt. I wasnt comfortable in my own skin. I didnt want to be me. My family never cared about me. I was never proud of my life. I ended up cutting my hair really short, because I obsessively dyed it different colors. I need help. I feel like I close to dying. its been like this for 1 year and 6 months. I set goals to get better. And yet I feel hopeless.

That looks are not your happiness, your worth, etc. No matter where you are in life, you&#39;re going to have problems.

It always has to be the man that introduces the woman to new things that the woman has never even considered experiencing on her own before.

So in the end it&#39;s not about satisfying others, it&#39;s about being comfortable in your own shoes and embracing your talents and gifts. Embrace who you are inside, not the exterior.",1
4760,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Could she be any more of a hypocrite???<br><br>She made her life and living through her looks and now she has the nerve to tell people that looks aren&#39;t everything??? <br><br>I call bs on that one!!!,1

A few of her remarks are sarcastic , when she says shes a pretty white girl and that she won a genetic lottery, shes making clear shes a model merely for chance and because of the hypocritical western standards.

4865,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I believe it wasnt until people started to value you by your looks.,1
4866,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This isnt her point but has to be said we all want what others have. We all have insecurities. Me being ugly its true i want surgery to help with insecurities but at the end of the day will that be enough. Looks aren&#39;t everything because its all she could have and now shes stuck with it. She now want education and can prevent her from getting another job. Also looks fade. So be careful what you ask for. But she is so intelligent and i would have never guessed because i judged her before she spoke. This message can be perceived in different ways. But really needed to hear this. Thanks ted talks. No im not saying pretty people are not smart but instead focused on her look.,1

4873,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I was meditating in my back yard today. I had a thought : weight and outer appearence truly to the core does not have to impact how we feel about ourself and our happiness. I said to myself there should be a video made by a model speaking of that. I have always been slim most my life and felt empty inside and at times have gained weight and felt so happy then let the obsession of the world get to me and loose weight again be at my ideal weight what i was in high school 5 years ago and here I am depressed as ever even tho on the outside i look good,  i feel ugly fat and worthless.<br>Any ways my point here is meditation and manifestion is just...... woah. And the power of prayer. It was just really strange I had this exact thought there should be a video about a model talking about how outward appearance does not matter sometimes because im sure there are models out there who look a certain way but feel one way and im scrolling on my youtube home page and see this video. Idk. Stay true",1
4874,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;ve heard that before about models getting more and more insecure about their looks the more successful they become because the focus intensifies.

They also take it out harder on their daughters and step daughters, speaking from experience.",1

But sometimes I&#39;m Insecure about my hair not being shiney or my thighs being big. Luckily there are wigs and photoshop for that.

If she were a little less lucky, she might be grateful. <br>Because someone is favored does not automatically mean another is oppressed.

While there are so-called advantages to being &#39;White&#39; (of which I am) I&#39;ve grown tired of the inherent blame-game and, moreover, why the so-called advantage exists. -Side-notes: I dig a person, and their color is irrelevant. If I don&#39;t prefer a given sexuality or culture, it&#39;s not only my right but impossible to reprogram... That said, whereas postjudice is logical, i hate prejudice. Yet, in America, some can&#39;t stand Whites. They blame us for a lot, as if every one of us can magically change the world. What they don&#39;t blame us for is, because we came here and were most educated and industrious, that we built a nation; the most powerful, successful, technological, agricultural, civil-rights conscious, inclusive, freedom-loving nation in the world. Is it perfect? No? (reference &#39;Trump&#39;). We have a long way to go, still. Even so, White&#39;s and this nation created mostly by Whites, are the most entertainment and technologically stolen from, and culturally appropriated from, &#39;race&#39; ever. The world wears baseball caps and blue jeans while they talk on I-phones and play their Xbox... all while drinking Coca Cola and woofing down cheeseburgers. - All I&#39;m saying is, non-Whites aren&#39;t perfect either, so try to look on the bright side from time to time, and remember we get to write and read these comments because we came out on the right side of World War 2 (for starters).

How are people getting annoyed with that? <br><br>All she is saying is, that her beauty gave her unfair privileges in life and she feels bad for that. Partly because she sees other people struggle for their lack of the (current) perception of beauty. Also, even though she recognizes her own benefits from this society, it does not eliminate her insecurities. <br><br>Seems perfectly sympathetic to me. <br><br><br>But I also understand those, who doesn&#39;t feel beautiful, who sees this and think: If she feels bad, I feel really bad. <br>But I think the point here is that, what is being portrayed as a benefit, can also be a curse.",1

Of course, there are exceptions, but sometimes its just that people dont know how to dress or to fix themselves according to their shape.

5069,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I clicked on this video because of the words in the title &quot;model | Cameron Russell&quot;,1
5070,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for sharing your perspective. It&#39;s nice to hear directly from someone from the modeling industry to encourage young girls to achieve their dreams and posing important issues based on image.<br><br>I&#39;m going to share this on Facebook.,1
5071,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There are more downsides to being pretty than she mentions. <br>Whenever I see a girl or guy who I think is extremely pretty or handsome I automatically think that they are going to be cold and mean. I think they are going to act stuck up or act like and a-- hole. I definitely don&#39;t treat &quot;pretty&quot; people with more respect, I veer away from them. What good is being pretty if people are going to assume you&#39;re not kind?<br>What happens if you built your whole identity off of being &quot;pretty&quot;? When you get older and you don&#39;t look as pretty, you may struggle with your identity. <br>If you&#39;re pretty, people automatically assume you are not smart. People don&#39;t often take what you say seriously. <br>&quot;Pretty&quot; people might have a significant other who only likes them superficially. I always noticed how the people I knew that were more attractive were in tumultuous relationships whereas the people who weren&#39;t stereotypically pretty were in happy committed relationships. I believe it&#39;s because they were able to find relationships that were built off of more than just looks. <br>I am not denying that pretty people receive more privilege in the world. I am saying there are more negative sides to being pretty than she talks about. <br>I think the only thing we can do it to feel beautiful from the inside and treat people with equal respect.",1
5072,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nice,1
5073,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Im a male model and some girls wont date me because Im too attractive<br>They feel like dont deserve such a good looking guy. <br><br>Its quite sad. <br><br><br><br>So if your insecure just know you can get a awesome guy,1

5075,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Being smart isn&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m Tony Stark.",1
5076,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You should not feel guilty for being beautiful and smart. You should not be a model though. People should believe in themselves and not in models. Everyone should be a model of good behavior and good judgment.,1
5077,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Underwear model? I don&#39;t believe her....no evidence!,1
5078,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,....but LOOKS make up 99.99999999999999999999999% of EVERYTHING.,1

5080,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very professional she is so truthful she said about how models feel and long careers in their lives...Really goose bumping words and thoughts she shared...We love her and honor her always...Topless top models have ups and down in life which makes them super models.,1

5084,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron Russell is a Beautiful woman and well-spoken in this presentation. However, as with my judgement of all people, I need more than 9m37s to determine what I think of her as a person. For me, she gets  some negative points for generalized comments on oppression. But again, I need more than a few comments to know what she is as a person, unlike the SJWs and Busch Beer who screwed over sick children in the Carson King doxing.<br><br><br>There are things one can do to be more attractive, but to be elite, you must win that lottery. Unfortunately, SJWs are ruining that too.<br><br><br><br>Tiger Woods, Einstein and the Clintons also won  genetic lotteries, but of a different kind. Perhaps we all win a lottery prize of some kind and the trick is to discover it. I could practice golf 10x harder than anyone in history and never approach Tiger&#39;s golf TALENT. Same for Einstein&#39;s abilities in math and science or the Clintons&#39; ability to convince enough people to let them get away with anything. Next to people who never discover their DNA lottery prize, I would say the biggest losers of the genetic lottery would be indecent people who cannot even see how atrocious they are as human beings. Would you want Robert Deniro&#39;s fame and acting skills yet continually behave such a vicious, bigoted, petty and hateful child?<br><br><br>Would anyone listen to Alyssa Milano if she wasn&#39;t famous and formerly hot? Sure, looks cut her that deal, but today, Social Justice Warriors will destroy anyone without cause simply because they are triggered. They openly say that white people are evil, which makes white people &quot;fair&quot; target in their eyes (selectively by politics, of course). Ilhan Omar would say Jews won a certain lottery and her inner-SJW is entitled to destroy them all. <br><br><br>It&#39;s like a fantasy game where someone like Bill Clinton can just play his &quot;Charisma 1000&quot; card and get away with anything. I&#39;ll play my &quot;Logical Free Thinker 100&quot; card and keep calling him a despicable person, though.",1

For she herself does not consciously get her point. This video is a confession of a guilty conscience. She feels bad for making a lot of money while promoting prejudices against all those people she mentions. She feels bad for not having enough courage to say no to the industry which promotes those prejudices while paying her. And she is afraid that had it not been for that lucky day, she would have never become so successful.  We all have weaknesses. We all have fears. I don&#39;t blame her.

5097,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not true. There are certain looks that are intrinsically tied with personality. For example scumbags that look like scumbags, Slags that genetically look like slags, and the concrete example is the non medical obese adult. This last person is always a greedy manipulative selfish character. I don&#39;t even need to debate it. Just think of the fat people you know and they are all  deceitful scumbags. <br><br>Skinny people are skinny because they eat less calories then their body requires. This takes willpower to control diet, fast or exercise.  A  fat person doesn&#39;t have this character strength  or does  not want to bother. They are content at  little exertion for max reward. This methodology they use in all aspects if their life. Therefore it&#39;s pretty obvious why fat people are scumbags. I say fat i mean the non medical fat adult",1

I am white and have never gotten away with anything, nor had a privileged life; in fact, quiet the opposite, and people have  take advantage of me all the time, and that has pretty much been the story of my life---despite me being white, so this talk is bull.

We have been guilty of oppression and should work towards preventing oppression.  The grass only seems greener on the other side.  Why not make the grass green on both sides.  I agree, and good solid advice.   But, with the devil being in the details it becomes much easier to only imply the source and solutions to the problem.  The tactic goes like this: Lets state a legit fact in detail quickly followed by: ....and thus is caused by A.  And A is obvious and can be derived from my experience, which can obviously be projected upon the population as a whole.  To that process, I disagree.  To the implied assertion: Make it into claim and support it with argument.  Allow for counter argument (not straw men arguments).  That is honesty.  That is how lasting change will occur.",1

5117,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Most of the people commenting didn&#39;t actually pay attention to what she was saying. This girl&#39;s main point is that looks don&#39;t exempt you from being insecure. She didn&#39;t say looks don&#39;t matter or aren&#39;t important; in fact, in contrast to that, she admitted that she won the genetic lottery and that her looks open doors for her and give her a better treatment in social life..",1
5118,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A lot of ignorance over there. The Truth is, image is not about luck or genetics or whatever. What you perceive as an image is the divine/perfect expression of who someone is. Anyone can be fucking beautiful. If you start recognize your own beauty and stop creating ugliness by your Own thoughts, then other people will start to see that same beauty. But you have to create it first. You have to recognize your inner beauty. Because image is just the shadow of the thing. If you don&#39;t like the shadow, maybe start shaping yourself differently. Use differents thoughts.<br>And sorry but, this girl is talking about insecurity but we all have insecurity from time to time. If you can think, then you can be insecure. Simple as that ^^",1
5119,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You&#39;re uncomfortable because you know that, you&#39;re a hypocrite!!!!! You&#39;re thin and pretty but you&#39;re not, the prettiest girl either. Iman is stunning and 3 times your age. I didnt mention her, for her colour but her beauty. Nobody wants to hear your moaning. You remind me of a poor, little, rich girl that tells us all, how miserable being a multi millionaire is!!! You were right to take advantage of your looks and sell them, to the highest bidder though. Also, looks DO matter. Men of 6 feet and over, earn more money and have better looking wives than, smaller men. They are also more likely, to be CEOs etc and the alpha male in sports and anything else they do. Yes, there are exceptions to everthing. Danni Davito is an ugly midget but he&#39;s very rich. Meat Loaf is even uglier but these men, have talents that dont require looks. Mind you, good looks are preferable, in the music industry too but there are exceptions. Nobody cares that you are insecure!!!!!!!! We&#39;d all love to have your imaginary insecurity. Plus, 99 % of the time you have to pay for goods, just like the rest of us. The dress was given to you so, that the designer and shop would get free advertising from you, telling the &#39;free dress&#39; story. You&#39;re not Elizabeth Taylor, Iman or Christie Brinkley beauty either. Your model looks are very pedestrian . You don&#39;t even stand out from the crowd!! Plus, spare us the faux profiling outrage. The reason young, black, men are screened more is because they are the ones, most likely to be the criminals!!! The American jail system can attest to that. It is the exact same in England. Stabbings and other crimes, went up when the government stopped their stop and search of blacks. Now, they can do it again and crime rates have decreased!! Blacks are 13 %of the American population yet commit, most of the crimes. The %is even less when you exclude elderly, sick, disabled and younger kids!! I say, younger as many black kids from 8 years old, are hood rat drug dealers!!! So, spare us your &#39;I want to sound intelligent speech!&#39;. Also, many models aren&#39;t even classically beautiful. That red head from Harry Potter movies, Daisy I think her first name is, is a pale, very ugly, redhead. She has a good education though and she&#39;s to be commended for that. When you parade around in your bra and panties, nobody is going to take what you have to say, seriously lol. If you&#39;re so miserable and insecure then, give up your job and find a meaningful life instead. Help others by doing charity work and stop being so ungrateful, for a very  successful and yes, quite often a glamorous job. If you hate yourself so much, go and work at McDonalds!!!",1

That is absolutely true but... who wants to be ugly? Who doesn&#39;t like to look at beauty. Let&#39;s be honest, beauty is not everything but it&#39;s not nothing either.  And you can try to tell a person what to find beautiful but, just as it&#39;s always been, in the end they will decide for themselves. They will either agree or disagree but no one has the right to demand that you find them attractive. So yeah, it&#39;s not everything but it&#39;s not nothing.",1

She mentioned it, it was all constructions, it wasnt me. Clearly, shes not happy. She was under control, being told what to do. She felt suffocated and somehow trapped within herself and that sucks. Also, shes not happy with the fact that all the benefits she received were solely due to her looks, not for who she is personally. Whats the point of having all those but you remain unhappy? Shes not being ungrateful for her looks but she also cant deny that looks or beauty doesnt last. I believe neither can we. Hence the title looks is not everything.",1

5143,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am a 51 year old wheelchair user from birth. Thumbnail pic is me, age 50, when taken. I grew up knowing I fit the white standard of beauty. At the same time I was made very aware that I was not supposed to. Disability placed me at the heart of a basic societal conflict. Disability is both feared, &amp; undesired. It in no way reflects or meets any standard of beauty. Disability from the societal view or narrative, is perceived as something to be fixed, overcome, or mercifully done away with. I am the embodiment of both high value, &amp; no value. White privilege, &amp; fear / oppression. I am a disabled woman. I would have it no other way. It is a defining characteristic. A bedrock of identity. Much like, my brown hair. Blue eyes. Sarcastic wit, &amp; innate talent / ability to sing. Disability is neither positive or negative. It simply is. All of these contradictions help shape the person I am. I love being me. Beauty is powerful. It is only one kind of power, however. It is neither deep, or lasting. Life is not what happens, to you. Your reactions, create your reality. We are all a mass of contradictions. What we choose to do with them, is what matters. Finally, someone can become more or less, beautiful. Depending on what you find, as you get to know them. Regardless of what you look like. If you are confident. If you like, &amp; accept yourself. It comes across, &amp; you allow others to do the same.",1
5144,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is a good presentation. She&#39;s is basically describing the superficial side of life, in my opinion. &quot;Superficial&quot; as in &quot;external&quot;; people can make judgements of a person from the outside, however they will never know what is really going on on the inside of that individual&#39;s mind. I&#39;m a half decent looking woman and have had a complete mixture of behaviours from people: women looking at me like they want to kill me, women noticing me and being positively genuine, men yelling harassment at me, men looking at me intensely then purposely laying into me, and men being complete gentlemen to me. Of course I&#39;m talking about people who I don&#39;t know who I run into whether in the street, store or at an event I&#39;ve been invited to. None of these people know me and I&#39;ve noticed that many seem to form an instant opinion. But that very small number who haven&#39;t have become great friends or at least a tiny positive memory in my life journey. It&#39;s important to really take care of our precious minds - this is the biggest lesson I&#39;ve learned.",1

The insinuation that the industry is somehow racist gets thrown out there, and then she starts talking about random people getting stoped and searched in NYC.  This was not only a meaningless talk but it shows that people will literally call anything racist. They&#39;ve been brainwashed to precieve all things this way.  All industry&#39;s cater to the market demands and also law of averages. If your in a country like  the USA. Which is probably about 80% white your probably going to have the majority of the type of people that live in a country doing the majority of jobs.  Litteraly nothing but the law of averages. It would be pretty odd if in china they made sure 50% of every job went to someone that wasn&#39;t ethnically Chinese.  Just to prove they weren&#39;t racist.  <br>Please come back to reality and stop thinking your somehow a noble person for identifying all things in life as racist. That only creates racism.

If you were born with a different face and body people would face you differently. Not only random people but also the ones that are important to you.

If it wouldn&#39;t be considered &quot;wrong&quot; for a person with high intelligence to become a highly paid brain surgeon, why is it considered wrong for a person who&#39;s born beautiful to become a highly paid Model?<br><br>Ofcourse looks matter... But most people have something to offer the world that matters as well... a talent, a quirk, a shining personality or some other gift that gives them an edge as well... If you don&#39;t have looks, then chances are you have another gift that gives u an edge in life... you just need to figure out what it is that you are particularly good at.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with utilizing the gifts you were born with! Whether it&#39;s looks, intelligence, talent, personality, charm.... Whatever... If your lucky to have been born with a quality you can profit from... Good for you! Why do I get the sense that she&#39;s almost apologizing for being beautiful?<br><br>This woman should embrace her gift more, and stop being ashamed of it! I wonder if she realizes that it starts to become a bit insulting to us &quot;less than beautiful&quot; folks when we admire her amazing beauty, only to see that she does not even fully appreciate it!",1

Should an intellectual blessed with a high IQ give a talk that implied it wasnt fair that he can profit from understanding difficult concepts when others are not so blessed? Ridiculous.

5243,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thinking about how images are powerful reminds me of  Alan watts. He said specifically about himself... &quot;Our personality is what we call our image, our image of ourselves and also the thought of our self our idea about ourselves. This is the person. In other words, what people meet and understand as Alan watts is a big act which is not reeally me because in the image of &#39;Alan watts&#39; there are not all my unconscious processes both psychological and physical. The construction of my brain is not contained in the concept &#39;Alan Watts&#39; and the concept &#39;Alan Watts&#39; does not contain the inseparable relationships which I have with all the rest of the universe. Therefore that concept is a fraud.<br><br><br>In simpler terms, our personality is non-existent as is simply an illusion. Think of an animal such as a lion. Lions mainly live to survive right? Imagine that the lion was similar to that of a human and had a personality, e.g the lion is funny, rich, etc. These are mere concepts, nothing more. What is not a concept is that the lion is simply apart of nature and in that of itself is irrelevant to propose any meaning in life. It can only manifest a meaning to follow through its own mind.",1

For those of us who struggle with the fact that there are some people who won&#39;t give us a chance I feel sorry for them-the ones who judge people too quickly. They will miss out on getting to know really cool people. I know this firsthand, because I&#39;ve gotten to know a lot of awesome people who either don&#39;t look like models, or don&#39;t seem that smart or talented.

A  very pretty girl get tested every day if she has couple, because 99% of men are offering themselves to her 24 hours a day, directly, which is less common, or indirectly with present gift, smile, look, seduction game, etc just for sexual thing, she or he can be tested because the future couple may have chosen themed them for their look, then end up divorcing when they get used to their look or they lose the look, while average looking girls or men are most likely chosen for other traits they show.. which mean on average have a higher chance to have their couple by their side in old age! etc etc etc it , that in the end we face same difficulty, see suicide rate in different social &quot;class&quot;   you find happy poor people and miserable ones, happy rich people and sad ones. etc etc..It get deeper than that way deeper, if one use his head. we all have tests all there is no such thing as unfair life, but unfair superficial people . by the way I am an average looking guy who uses his brain.",1

When Im married Ill be happy, when I have children Ill be happy, when Im skinnier Ill be happy, when I have more money Ill be happy, when Im successful Ill be happy... Thats how it always has been and always will be for those who cant find happiness within themselves or with God. So long as we can pinpoint some external thing that will make us happy, then we can avoid looking inward and facing what is really making us unhappy.",1
5279,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Dont get me wrong, she looks good, but models are not the most attractive people on earth. I see more attractive women daily. Also I&#39;m glad she showed those pictures on the same day and rhs shoots. Surprised people actually think this look like that all the time.",1
5280,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love how the majority of these comments didnt even listen to what she was saying... and instead just shared their preconceived notions while she was trying to explain they werent 100% true<br>:))),1
5281,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s just funny how you all don&#39;t get it - she has the look and still doesn&#39;t have everything - therefore she says: Looks aren&#39;t everything. <br>Seriously how stupid are people here?,1
5282,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I have the heart breaking impression that no one is really understanding what she&#39;s trying to say. :-/ I thought this Ted Talk was .... my ah-ah-moment.,1
5283,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s a mix of lies and truths, what do we do in these cases? Yes, you look beautiful because you have the profile that heterosexual men like (I am not hetero sexual btw, ew - see, here I am deconstructing the norms, by showing contempt to something that most people admire and aspire to.) Now, black and latino teenagers also fit profiles, these guys are usually more prone to being violent and criminal. Are they simply being discriminated for something they don&#39;t deserve? Maybe, but the reality is many of them are indeed criminals, or dishonest, or bad character. These are profiles and they have some truth to them. And just like profilings have bad traits, they also have good traits. So, your speech is biased towards their good sides, whilst totally ignoring the bad side.",1
5284,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s so gorgeous,1
5285,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Um, lots of males who dress up as female to be models. Take a closer look friends, its male",1
5286,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"first model who admits she won a genetic lottery; thank you !! I am a daughter of an average italian mother, who is average height and weight; monica bellucci is not the typical italian woman; and so accept who you are doesnt mean dont make any effort to be the best version of your self....I lost insecurity somehow, when I gained power over what people think of me and my looks.... and above all, not being a model helps to accept that I am not perfect and yet feel charming :) enjoy",1
5287,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"LOVE this talk so much! And more people need to actually try and watch the video before trying to blabber the same thing over and over again based on the title alone. Seriously, it&#39;s not even that long.",1
5288,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I commend you Cameron for your raw honesty on the benefits you have received/receive from being beautiful. Transparency on this topic is rare. Whats even rarer and more commendable (in my opinion) is your courage to publicly admit and discuss that you have insecurities too, just like the dang rest of us! As a woman, I appreciate you sharing this with me! Thats a very personal AND powerful insight from someone whos physical features are idolized by the media, thus the public. Although Im not a super model, I am a white female American, so I appreciate the reminder that I do receive certain benefits from something I had nothing to do with, and that on the flip side of that, there are obstacles that others will have to overcome through no fault of their own. Great message. Great depth. Great delivery. You go girl!! ",1
5289,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You dont look like a model.,1
5290,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Poor little rich girl,1
5291,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Most people should watch the video again . U guys dont understand anything.<br><br>Stop bashing her.,1
5292,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think the point she was trying to make was that you get treatet based your looks a lot and that it&#39;s unfair and that doesn&#39;t indicate how capable of a person you are. And even if you&#39;re lucky it doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re happy. Not that looks don&#39;t matter, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s not everything.",1
5293,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She turned orthodox jewish in 5 seconds with that skirt.,1
5294,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes aren&#39;t everything but something of everything,1
5295,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"My question is, did any ugly lady ever say that looks don&#39;t matter? U&#39;re kidding me",1
5296,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One doesn&#39;t care about the things that one has. One cares about things that one doesn&#39;t have. People are greedy. But once they get what they want, they don&#39;t care about it and lose interest. It&#39;s reality.",1
5297,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It took a lot of courage to come out and speak the truth. Thank you for being honest.,1
5298,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"being pretty is not all it&#39;s cracked up to be. i have seen beautiful people being broken by ugly jealous people. the sexualization and potential dangers that come with being pretty still scares me. by the way happily fat and ugly here, no media is going to tell this disenfranchised aboriginal woman what to be..Do you know what I find weird though people from my Rez don&#39;t treat me good, yet people of any other community or race treat me like gold and I am grateful for that! nothing but love for you all, sorry if i am off topic",1
5299,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Actually loooks give happiness for others and money give insecurity to others and for self peace  u should b completely control of your mind or u never feel happiness and secure with beauty and money,1
5300,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think the title doesnt say what the piece is about. In her case: Looks arent everything but they are a lot. I mean she says herself that bc she is a white, beautiful woman she has had a lot of benefits. This doesnt mean that she is necessarily happy and feels good about herself as well.",1
5301,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Out of jealousy some people treat good looking people badly, and they block them in every possible way",1
5302,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was probably the worst ted talk I&#39;ve watched yet,1
5303,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Glad this lady tells the truth, as an aspiring biochemist I plan to make drugs that will make people better looking probably going to be one of the few that will do research and development in this. I think models learn the truth about looks through their career.",1
5304,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love this,1
5305,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think for someone whos had it all, <br>Its brave to come out and say nothing is what it seems and that she STILL feels insecure about herself. <br>What she said about race was thought provoking and it is wrong and unfair for certain groups to always be picked on by the police but unfortunately they are the ones most commonly found to be doing the things that are against the law. <br><br>Nothing will ever change. <br>The world and its leaders are just as horrible and vile as those years before. <br><br>Education and faith are two of the most important things. <br>Whenever either of these lack- humanity lacks, leaving individuals to lack - therefore the whole of society lacks and we have conflicts that will never stop.",1
5306,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Loved it ,1

5308,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That&#39;s a drag queen,1
5309,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are the everything. What makes you believe in this was how you were treated. How about you find a real gentleman? Maybe you already found. Whatev,1

5312,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Okay guys if looks were everything i guess u would not watch even a single teds talk&#39;s videos of any of the successful people she is here because she is successful not for her looks nd even if she wasn&#39;t pretty she might had been here for some other reason so being successful is all matters nd that definitely is in ones own hands,1

5317,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"we can say looks dont matter, but deep down everything to do with the way we look determines how we are treated everyday",1
5318,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,people never talk about how they dont help themselves in the looks category either. having pride in oneself is attractive in itself,1
5319,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why do rich and beautiful people always have the need to tell people that money and looks doesnt bring happiness. Like huh?,1
5320,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a fucking joke....,1
5321,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Gist of the Talk: Im sorry I won the genetic lottery and it sucks for P&#39;sOC and ugly people, please applaud me for my realization!&quot;. I have no clue why people are applauding her in the comments, but she could have added more to her story about maybe helping others, than just crying about how she got everything in life because she was hot. Compare this with an amazing Ted Talk by Sting. He narrates a life story, and doesn&#39;t go on telling the audience about how &#39;talent is his curse&#39; or something.",1

5325,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Tall and fair skin is actually beautiful. I think it&#39;s part of what psychologists call universal beauty. And the modern world knows the power of makeup. If you can fill in tall and fair skin, makeup can finish the rest if you have a universally average face. Average means perceived to be well proportioned to human eyes. The white face tends to be like this on average compared to other notable ethnic groups. So it&#39;s just the way it is. No hard feelings. And every ethnic groups have favoritism for their own people.",1
5326,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s all about $$$. At some point someone figured it&#39;s highly profitable to grab a tall white girl and do photoshop and makeup on her. She just has to look fair and tall. Also, good looking people do get favoritism everywhere in society. It&#39;s like a sexual hierarchy that everyone understands deep inside their minds. That the prettier one is valuable and is in the position to say yes or no. So this is subconsciously perceived as a form of power and other people want to be in good terms with them.",1
5327,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Interesting talk, but the direction or impact was missing.",1

5356,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol what a terrible ted talk. Its like she wanted us to feel sorry for her?,1
5357,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everyone in the comments is saying that it&#39;s easy for her to say because she is pretty. But if she wasn&#39;t and she said those that pretty people have it easier people would be calling her bitter.,1

I am pretty positive that that study was done in America, where the population is roughly 60% white. Sure, the demographics don&#39;t match with the numbers, but with consideration that many non-white citizens tend to be immigrants that came here in the last century or two, and many without a sufficient financial basis to be apart of the lifestyle that models are generally found in, the statistical connection is a weak one at best.

5416,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Surprised so many people don&#39;t hear what she is saying. She is not saying looks don&#39;t make a difference. She is saying that even if you are a model who gets all these benefits better looks doesn&#39;t help you feel good good about yourself, really.",1

5442,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I appreciate how I look and dress. My work place has a casual dress code and I dress up in very nice casual office appropriate clothing. But I was just told last week that I wouldn&#39;t get a promotion since I didn&#39;t have any makeup on and didn&#39;t wear business attire. They told me to fix my appearance a little bit more. I really want this promotion too. I have been asking myself for a week now if my looks really matter? Does this make any sense? I&#39;ll be happier in the position I want but I won&#39;t get it due to my appearance. So...,1

5540,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I dont think most people in the comments understand the point she is trying to make. Shes not saying that looks dont matter. She says that no matter how beautiful other people perceive you at the end of the day you can still be very insecure and unhappy with your looks.,1

5557,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Okay hold the door. Everyone saying &quot;pretty people saying looks aren&#39;t everything is like rich people saying money isn&#39;t everything&quot;. She was born this way. If you are saying she what is saying is discredited because she is pretty than you are part of the problem. This is such an important message that she is sharing with the masses and she is sharing it especially because she is in an industry where looks is everything and she can see how it is affecting people and hurting them. Her voice should weigh more than ever before because she is probably one of the most qualified people to talk out about and speak up about this topic. So if you are saying she can&#39;t have this TED talk because she is pretty then you really need to listen to it again and really listen to what she has to say.

5562,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I dont know why women keep telling people that,nobody actually believes that looks are everything and even the ones who do theyd be interested in having fun with &quot;looks&quot; while making sure they dont give more than the acceptable amount of &quot;payment&quot; for these looks,thats why women demand more when they look good,call it what you want,a ride a date an apartment or &quot;feelings&quot; depanding on how much a man has of what hes willing to give up,but looks are the filter that separates the sexually desirable from the undesirable,theres way more investigations going on in a mans head than women can comprehend.",1
5563,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Dude she randomly looped race  into the talk,1
5564,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Um uh uhhh umm uh....,1
5565,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So basically what shes saying is dont be black.,1
5566,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she has no oratory skills and poor speaker just people laughing for no reason,1
5567,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is definitely the worst TED talk,1
5568,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,harika,1
5569,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It didn&#39;t take her 6 seconds to change, but 42 seconds from the point where she actually starts to get changed.",1
5570,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You are totally wrong, looks are everything. I am 5&#39;tall and not very good looking and women only wants a prize trophey.",1
5571,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,can people actually shut up. FFS. What she was saying is that this is a privelage yes but it doesnt make your life automatically great. She had to grow up way to fast. in that picture of her in the bikini she looked like an adult but she didnt even have her PERIOD. God people can be so frickin&#39; annoying this isnt about you.,1
5572,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A person with nice personality and nice look always has more advantages.But a person with the same personality and ugly doesnt have the same.This is unfair.But the worst is that and be with a excellent personality sometimes it hasnt matter.Because the look not always but a lot of times wins.Always the person with good looking has more advantages always.Ugly people who work a lot at themselves  they cant win that which beautiful people  has with a little work and sometimes nothing.And for that simply reason this is  UNFAIR!THE TRY DOESNT MATTER,1
5573,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It seems most people missed the point of her talk. That real love and affection and success does not come from the outside but from what you bring from the inside. That is being a caring inspiring and creative human being,1

5576,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Love it! I am glad I was open-minded and open-hearted enough to watch the whole video. I realised that I was prejudiced against models at the beginning... thank you, Cameron, for opening up my eyes to this. Plus, I have been following some training in public speaking and have to say that your talk is VERY well put together and delivered. Congrats!",1

5578,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The first thing came into my mind <br>Are u serious!!!seriously ,1
5579,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This whole Ted talk is really confusing to me... So I guess her point was is that her perfect looks don&#39;t make her happy in the end? and models are insecure? Why not just say that rather than go off and focus on all the successful things in life that were basically handed to her because of the way she looks??? That just made the message very mixed up and confusing. The point of the talk really got lost in everything else she was trying to say about how great being beautiful really is and everything it got her. Looks defintly matter though... They use looks to sell products, in movies, magazines... It&#39;s everywhere and constantly engraved into our minds that we must be beautiful to achieve and to succeed. It&#39;s just like going on social media. I did an experiment recently...  I posted a post straight from my heart and soul, barely any recgonition at all. But if I post a revealing picture (or if I was brave enough to post one of my backside), lots of recongition then, comments and likes and all that... I&#39;d rather be recongized for my mind and heart rather than what I look like, but the fact is, that none of that stuff matters except for the way I look. It&#39;s been confirmed multiple times to me that my heart and soul does not matter over looks. My heart and mind go under appreciated. Society is very messed up unfortunately. But yes, this talk was very confusing. If the message was simply that modeling didn&#39;t make her happy and that they are some of the most insecure people, it would have only taken seconds to say that...",1
5580,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks can only get you this far and then she opens her mouth,1
5581,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Love to meet the next Ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet. :),1

5587,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I promise u if by miracle i became pretty i would be happier im not saying im gonna be happy <br>Im saying happier .,1
5588,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think some of you missunderstood the meaning of succes in life ; its to be generally grateful and happy with what you already have and who you are as a person. If you dont have that, then there are not much things that will make you temporarily happy. I mean sure being rich is great, but what when you buy everything you ever wanted and more, and you&#39;re still feeling empty and shallow? It doesnt really matter what you have or not, but how you percieve your situation and make the best of it.<br><b>*</b><br>Also, i think you&#39;re beautiful and special &lt;3 :)",1
5589,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"thats so difficult.I hate my body,i hate my face,i hate my appearance in general.But i can say,that i heard that im pretty from soo many people,that i cant choice between my self hate and someones good opinion about me.Cause they say:&quot;Gosh youre so pretty,i wish i was you&quot;,i look at them like&quot;what tf are you saying&quot;,then look at myself,then at them again and it occures to me that they are just wanna be nice with me,cause i think im much uglier that they are.And when i see a really pretty girl,then we just talk and i understand that shes so insecure in herself and i cant get it around my head,really.",1

5591,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But youre freaking pretty in the first place,1
5592,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Model is a good looking person but at the same time they are so affraid everyday about their looks because of pressure of their work,1
5593,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When I saw the title, I thought it would be going a bit arrogant way of video. &quot;Believe me (*because*) I&#39;m a model. But she was there being vulnerable and being humble. This talk changed my mind about her and the subject. Thanks!",1
5594,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why she is telling this to.people when she has everything just for looks,1
5595,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Become a small Asian man and live in London please. You will know what are you talking about.,1
5596,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She talking at teds proves that looks matter,1
5597,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This Ted talk said nothing.,1
5598,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think what she wants to emphasize on is that the image media portrays is fake.,1
5599,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Someone good looking but with terrible personality and unbearable.....you get dissapointed in this case i think,1
5600,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"All of you people here are whining about how only pretty people say that looks dont matter and only rich people say that money doesnt matter, thats because they already got the looks and money and they realise more than anyone that all those things wont make anyone happy it can actually make you more insecure and sad. <br><br>That was what she was trying to explain throughout the video, too bad no one understood.",1
5601,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I didnt understand her message. Whats a sense?! <br>Really models are pretty silly ,1
5602,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Would she marry a plain normal working guy then?.,1
5603,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Okay I finally watched it YouTube there you go,1

5612,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That&#39;s because she&#39;s already tired of being beautiful. An ugly human like me can&#39;t relate,1
5613,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Being rich isn&#39;t that bad<br>Me: poor,1

5645,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"looks arent everything is something very easy to say when youre a model. you dont understand the hidden little benefits you get in life for being attractive. looks arent everything, but theyre worth more than personality. itd be nice if everyone could be all nice and happy, but thats just not how life works.",1

5661,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I hated this Ted talk,1
5662,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I am a model and everything she is saying about insecurity is correct! Good thing that she is speaking truth to the injustices of the entertainment industry,1
5663,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,All lies,1
5664,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That&#39;s why you can say that,1
5665,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I dont want to sound negative but looks arent everything said by one who is already have the privileged to be pretty,1
5666,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I would prefer to hear it from average person who is not concidered atractive in our society. We all need hear story about person who achieved goals without look and being rich,1
5667,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Seems most people have an issue with the title, which I admit is not apt and reductive.  The talk, however, hits the nail on the head and is a very good one in which she highlights industry biases",1
5668,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you&#39;re complaining about being ugly... too bad, go do something about it and quit crying... the world ain&#39;t gonna stop for you and give you a hug and a kiss to make you feel better.

5670,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yall shes just acknowledging her privilege and asking for more diversity in the beauty industry and change in the beauty Standards. Shes not saying looks dont matter,shes just saying that they shouldnt.And yeah,it is unfair,but you cant say you never thought about modeling to afford college (at least I cant ).Also she said that a pretty face and a smaller waist wont take all of your insecurities away,proving that beauty isnt everything in a mental healthy way,but it doesnt mean you wont be privileged so stop coming after her.",1
5671,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"-looks are not that important<br>+ Yeah, maybe, but I&#39;d like to discover it by myself",1
5672,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Something about the title is funny,1
5673,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"looks are like a first door to a person. if youre beautiful then that door is opened and people will go to the second door which is personality, who you really are, etc. if youre not attractive then the first door remains closed and people wont even bother trying to get to know you. Beautiful people say looks dont matter simply because its something they dont struggle with (so eventually personality will become their main focus) You can be unhappy for various reasons, but its unfair to say something doesnt matter because /you/ dont struggle with it. Ideally we all should focus on whats inside but the vast majority of people will never bother that much if theyre not impressed after a first, superficial glance towards someone.",1

5685,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"From my opinion, looks DEFINITELY matters. When I was attending high school there was an Indian girl who was constantly getting bullied because of her looks and she had an unibra. And I still don&#39;t understand why she was getting mistreatment by her classmates and it made me upset inside and some of them were calling her GODZILLA because she was chubby. Now we all can agree on one thing and that is &quot;LOOKS DEFINITELY MATTERS.&quot; Ugly looking people don&#39;t get the same treatment as the beautiful looking one.

5689,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What I noticed. She is a model, she thinks every white woman is like her and doesnt work. She assumes other people are privileged because she is. She doesnt know that everyone works but her. She is delusional about her own importance. She looks average, and got a job where she does not contribute to society. She objectifies herself and thinks that is what others do. She thinks beauty is what runs the world. People do not notice beauty in real world jobs and professional environments everyone is trained and works hard to serve the public. She stands there and looks pretty. She cannot speak for anyone but herself because she is a wall flower not a working professional.",1

5734,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,honestly I do believe that looks get better/worse with personality. I am talking to this guy rn. Before I thought he wasn&#39;t too attractive. But then we started hanging out more. He is really funny and nice and now I realize that he is like really cute.<br><br><br>I also have a opposite story. There is another boy I had a crush on for three years. I thought he was so beautiful. His face is perfect and his lips are amazing. But then I talked to him and he treated me like gutter trash.  He made me feel bad about myself. I don&#39;t think he is very attractive anymore...,1

5765,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great information. How do we change the narrative? We are all beautiful in some way and deserve to be treated with respect until the respect is violated.,1
5766,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Notice that she is saying looks are not everything which i also believe but is a quality which actually matters . Well if you are not gifted with this then do not regret and believe on yourself and your quality One day people will absolutely  give your example that actually &quot;LOOKS ARE NOT EVERYTHING&quot;,1
5767,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What is she trying to say??,1
5768,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What shes really trying to say for looks arent everything. Is to tell others especially little girls that want to be models that it isnt as worthwhile as it seems. Everyone thinks models are always happy and everything is awesome. But the reality is not that cheerful. Her message is not to always have your focus on looks because looks arent everything. <br><br>And also if anyone listens to Billie Ellish she says in her song if teardrops could be bottled there would be swimming pools filled by models. Because she thinks theyre one of the saddest people.,1

Watching the way people speak to your attractive friends. Who are probably married with kids.<br><br>Pretty people would be stunned at how overlooked and shunned ugly people are. Its brutal.",1
5770,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Most tv ads are using black people lately, not Asian, not Latino, not white, just mostly black.",1
5771,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s not the looks, it&#39;s the perception. How you and rest of the world might perceive beauty and humanity? It is true that an attractive person stands out from the crowd, but only at first glance. Seeing that face over and over, makes you get used to that attractive face, same with yourself. You grow up looking at yourself in the mirror as you are, it stays the same until you see new changes as &quot;acne or scars, etc&quot; on your face or when someone points it out for you, which ends up making you aware of yourself. Same analogy with the body, dramatic changes stand out like loosing your weight, even though, you internally haven&#39;t changed at all. <br><br>Another thought that comes into my mind with how people perceive beauty is by jealousy. In history, stories, myths, etc, the villain is perceived to be the bad one who gets jealous of main character whether it&#39;s looks, money, power, talent or other but the villain wants to have these yet can&#39;t attain them. This is a very natural yet common phenomenon that might go on till the end of humanity because humans can never sustain themselves and always want more. If our ancestors were perfectly satisfied with their living environments, they would&#39;ve had never made a recent comfortable world for us. It might also be seen as improvement, innovation, but to me, it&#39;s as humans just can&#39;t get enough, they would be greedy after more things because that is what&#39;s in our nature, what we possess. There are humans who overcome these (monks who shave their heads, strip themselves of a comfortable living to spend life in complete yet peaceful solitude with their beliefs). Same with nuns, and also same in many other religions who teaches to not be greedy and control our nature. In conclusion, the world, society, universe is quite bigger than our imagination, yet majority our stuck with their narrow minds and uncontrollable nature to perceive humans and the world recklessly. It&#39;s only good that we make ourselves aware of most scenarios, situations through others stories and struggles to understand ourselves and other humans more like the lady in the video. Keep feeding onto wisdom and understand yourself more to understand others around you.",1

5795,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Let me tell you, looks matter a LOT.  People judge you by your looks.  Attractive people are more likely to be trusted, and more likely to gain promotions.  Theyre more likely to be let off with warnings.  Theyre more likely to be able to attract a more desirable mate.  People are more polite to attractive people.  Pretty much everything about life is easier if youre attractive.",1

I ain&#39;t her so IDK for sure, of course).<br><br><br>A lot of the comments say that attractive people say that looks don&#39;t matter because they are good looking and better off. Attractive people say that because they know that if no one says it, everyone will believe something that is totally and completely false. <br><br><br>In the video, she says she and her friend were pulled over by a policeman, but the policeman let them go because they were pretty. What these comments say about the actual commenters is that they are like the policeman. Every single one of you that says, &quot;Looks don&#39;t matter- say the good looking people&quot; are like that very policeman.<br><br><br>Guys, take a look at yourselves. Looks matter to those that are biased, self-conscious, and/or unhappy. Don&#39;t you think we should start making others ignore how people look by ignoring it ourselves?",1

Outside of my day job, you&#39;re more likely to find me in dirty stained Carhartts and a button up work shirt and smelling like welding. I go into the same exact bank branch and talk to the same exact people, and the difference in the way I get treated changes incredibly depending on how I&#39;m dressed. Unfortunate truth, but right or wrong, the reality of the world is that looks matter.<br><br>Edit: Goes the other way too.

5894,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is why we need eugenics. The number of beautiful white girls as a percentage of the total global population is ridiculously low, and they very seldom have more than two children, especially in former communist countries. Absolutely nothing is being done about this because we are failing to look at beautiful girls as a finite resource, which means that policy makers are failing to encourage motherhood and immigration from (mostly Eastern) Europe. Most of the adult women in the United States who we think of as beautiful were born between 1990 and 2001. If you look it up, it&#39;s about 1.3 million white women per year. Of these women, perhaps a fourth of all girls approximately between the ages of 18 and 29 are fat or obese. Others are simply unattractive, and still others have diagnosable defects. That leaves the adult male population with under 12 million women, most of whom are in some form of monogamous sexual relationship or another. Meanwhile, the US in 2017 had close to 11 million millionaires, up 6 percent from 2016, according to data published in 2018 by the Spectrum Group&#39;s Market Insights Report. The US is literally getting to a point where you have to be a millionaire to date a beautiful white woman.  And about half of them have ugly tattoos.",1

I can relate to her about being pretty from this angle,  when I drove my clunker I didn&#39;t worry about it, parked it anywhere BUT when I drove my spiffed up rebuilt 1953 Chevy I always was worried about where I parked it, if anyone was going to scratch it and even how it was being admired or not.

I understand the main point that shes not this majestic being that people think she is and that shes also insecure herself.  So what?  Am I supposed to feel sorry for her?  She probably racks in hundreds of thousands of dollars by contributing to an industry that makes young women feel insecure with themselves everyday.

Today this kind of thinking has deteriorated even more becoming little more than downright insidious, virtue signaling. <br>Such a high percentage of girls are growing up with these distorted self images are largely not because of some advertisements, but because their parents arent there, especially their fathers to build them up and teach them their self worth.

6099,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I saw this when it first came out on YouTube, and I was pretty much questioning her. Like youre pretty, hello, who cares. But, after watching this again, nearly 6 years later, I understand now what she was talking about. I think people can have different takeaways. So, Im just stating my opinion. But for me, at its core this talk is about privilege. Its not about her being a pretty white woman saying shes insecure with her looks. Its about her using her privilege to bring awareness to prejudice. She gave this talk at a time when privilege wasnt aware to mass conscious. The BLM movement wasnt founded till a few months after this Ted, where I got a better grasp of it. A great example is when she compared her being let go for a traffic stop, against the amount of times a Black and Latino will be stopped just for their skin color. As well as when she talked about Tyra and Naomi being less than the 4% in the modeling industry. Theres a discrepancy in how people are treated that she was making a call to using her genetic lottery as that vehicle. So I hope people see that.",1

And this is the point that Cameron Russell was trying to drive home.... young girls cannot and should not feel insecure about themselves, because they are comparing themselves to models ...models with professional makeup, hair, special lighting, photoshop, etc.<br><br><br>It&#39;s all one big farce, all created to SELL PRODUCTS, COSMETIC SURGERY PROCEDURES, etc.",1

I for example have been labelled as fishing for compliments  anytime I was having issues however I have Body dysmorphic disorder I dont see myself how others see me. It gets irritating at times because no one takes your problems seriously. <br><br>Also, seeing peoples comments towards this just proves society is shallow.

Sure, it may be the technically correct message, in the sense that problems and insecurities are universal, and indeed money cannot buy happiness, but such a statement, delivered from a member of the haves to a population of true have-nots, comes across as not only silly, but deeply inappropriate, insulting, ignorant, condescending, and utterly dismissive of the experiences and narratives of a population with so much more an intimate knowledge and connection with true human suffering. Indeed, suffering, problems, and human insecurities are universal elements of the human experience, but when the vastly privileged appropriate this narrative as their own, when they become lecturers of the subject instead of listeners and learners, the end result can only be further harm, resentment, and alienation.

6294,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is stunning and she knows it-this is all bullshit,1
6295,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I really cant get over with the black and white swimwear picture... like wow such a young girl, she wasnt even a woman, yet the industry is already sexualising her body...this makes me sick",1
6296,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think a more important question is why do we define ourselves based on how others treat us? Whether you&#39;re treated well or badly for your looks, that shouldn&#39;t be your defining factor.",1
6297,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok I dont understand whats the point of her speech , is she trying to console the ugly and poor people....I was born beautiful nothing I can do about that , to top it all my father is wealthy , but something I didnt have was a family I was basically raised by servants and I was an only child , I was never jealous of pretty girls or wealthy people , all I wanted was a family ...the bottom line of my comment is simple in this life you cant have it all , and by the way, I know people that are average looking that have achieved personal success and are very happy with their lives .",1
6298,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That is a dude...in case you did not know. This is a shill channel, in case you did not know. All of ted talks are controlled opposition in case you didn&#39;t know. Do some damn research people.",1
6299,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"to be honest looks are everything...no matter how nice ,sweet and organic I am she wouldn&#39;t give me the time of day.<br>Not matter how much money I had she wouldn&#39;t except me or love me.<br>Looks are everything .<br>If you don&#39;t have them you will lead a life in which you will never be happy or satisfied.<br>Might as well just die.",1
6300,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,of course they arent <b>everything</b> .. theyre just the important thing,1
6301,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Whats the best way to meet and date an underwear model ?,1
6302,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t agree that being white necessarily equals having privilege any more,1
6303,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What was the entire point?,1
6304,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what a joke.  How you gonna model for a living and then say your looks don&#39;t matter?,1
6305,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sold out by his own mother, poor kid.",1
6306,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Stupidest TED talk ever. Looks arent everything just 99.99%. The other 0.01% is personality. She literally said she hit the genetic lottery and shes part of a legacy. How are looks not everything. Time and time again looks are the most important. She talks about people being CEOs being in charge. Science has proven that CEOs have a predisposition to be sociopaths. So its either mode good looks or sociopathy. She says be president of the United States. Would you rather look like President Obama or Tyson Beckford. Pick any white president ever VS looking like David Gandy. This talk has no merit. She got out of tickets because shes gorgeous. SJW at its finest,1
6307,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ironic.....looks aren&#39;t everything.....she is a model.....hahaha,1
6308,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A poem of the heart....<br><br><br>More than life itself, I love you.<br>Beyond your wildest dreams, I love you.<br>When you feel nothing, I love you.<br>When you are depressed and suicidal, I love you.<br>When you cannot face another day, I love you.<br>When you are all alone, I love you.<br>When no one else loves you, I love you.<br>When no one seems to care, I love you.<br>When the tears will not stop flowing, I love you. <br>When there is no hope left, I love you.<br>When you need a friend, I love you.<br>When you need a best friend, I am here.<br>I will never leave you.  <br>I will never forsake you.<br>I am always here.  <br>I will forgive every wrong thing that you have done.<br>I will overlook all of your mistakes.<br>I will help turn your sorrow into joy.<br>I will embrace you and hold you.<br>I will never, ever let you go.<br>If you will simply receive Me.<br><br>...That&#39;s all I ask.<br>              -The Lord Jesus Christ",1

6314,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks does matter lady. Good look is dued to good karma. But you can destroy the good look in any secs. If you are ugly, paying to gain beauty is a sense of paying for karma.",1
6315,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"it&#39;s sad how many people in this comment section are completely missing the point of this video  she&#39;s not &quot;complaining&quot; about being pretty, she&#39;s saying that it&#39;s unfair that she gets better treatment than regular people. y&#39;all are so focused on her being privileged that you fail to see that she&#39;s actually using her privilege to talk about important topics like this.",1

6321,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But i always hated that girls are so lucky they get handed everything to them freely with no cost or guilt that&#39;s the one thing i will say to my self that being a guy is not happy at all in some area in life.,1
6322,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,AKA i always hate it when a girl lie to her self and tries to buy skinny outfits to look skinny. Man i always hated that because you can tell its to tight and they always try to blame the clothes on the stores.,1
6323,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Image is superficial and bullshit and what?,1

Oh, I don&#39;t know, Like &quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything boys and girls! It is moral character and treating others like you want to be treated. Having a good head on your shoulders and always be willing to work hard and learn as much as you can!&quot; No... instead we just get another sermon about how bad white people are and how unfair we have all this unearned privilege! What a bunch of CRAP! WAKE UP! you brain-washed idiots!",1

6339,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thought experiment: Burning building. Two babies on different floors. Two crying mamas. Save my baby! But one Moms hot. The others a dog. Bloated fat body.   Chin hair. Whose baby would you get first? This is an evil test.,1
6340,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ill hold the door for a hottie. Fatties and uglies get your own door!,1
6341,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I bet she wouldnt date a fat poor guy no matter how nice he was,1
6342,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hey, a white privilege argument years before it became trendy ----  <br><br><br>There&#39;s little we can do about our looks.  Race and beauty are a genetic roll of the dice.  So why do people feel guilty for being white?",1

6350,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Pretentious......,1

6363,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not only was that first bit awkward but it was insulting to the audience. She made the assumption that everyone in the audience saw her in a different way in the first outfit, but not all of us are blinded by a sexy outfit or pretty appearance. It felt awkward because the message was that the audience had so little substance and intelligence that all she had to do was slip on a longer skirt and sweater to be able to &#39;trick&#39; them into not judging her. Pretty shallow thought process. Not everyone cares about what you look like....give us some credit.",1
6364,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really appreciate you speaking the truth there are so many people who are not as brave as you and would never speak on other peoples behalf.,1

6367,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I noticed she did not mention a woman could be any of the grueling jobs men do. Nor did she mention any of the dirty, high risk jobs men do. They always mention jobs that require a lot of intelligence and study resulting in high pay. .... I still can&#39;t get my 135 IQ, 21 yo granddaughter to replace her own flat tire, whether she knows how to do it or not. She called 911 from the interstate and got a male State Trooper to mount the spare.",1
6368,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I appreciate her doing this...but I would also like to hear from a model who is a minority and her journey,1

6370,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The truth is that it is easy to say that having a thing (beauty, wealth, etc.) is not important when you happen to have that thing. Getting a person who has much less of that thing to take what you have said seriously however is not easy.",1
6371,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is the best ted talk ever. She was born for this moment.,1
6372,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Can she build a good looking sammiche?,1

6386,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,They told him to arch his back bc he has a straight up and down back of a man.  Women have a natural S curve.  Men do not.  Ted is more mainstream programming for the masses.,1

6388,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m in awe of her honesty. She&#39;s clearly an enlightened individual. Fact remains , we are essentially evolved primates , and like all other living creatures on this moving rock our biological pull is to mate with the most attractive it&#39;s ingrained in all of us., but what&#39;s unattractive is the destruction of human self esteem when corporates manipulate the population for huge $$$..using this natural desire to be attracted ,<br>Utimately you have the power to switch it off and not buy into it if your strong enough , sadly as a species , we are easily manipulated.",1

6407,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I believe many of these super models especially the Victoria Secret models are transgendered men.  I feel so sad for young women who starve themselves thinking they too can look like that not realizing those mostly are male frames.,1

6417,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Too bad shes ashamed to be white.

6418,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So &quot;Beauty Privilege&quot; is not for real?  I&#39;m inclined to believe that the beautiful people  have an advantage from the start,1

6420,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not to criticise you but saying that you hadnt had your period yet when you were 15-16, is in my view an inauthenticity, unless that were a medical condition. I just couldnt believe that. Perhaps you said it to make sure your story got more impact? To shake up the world a little more so that more little girls choose to do something more meaningful with their lives instead of getting sucked in this superficial idea of beauty and being a model. I admire that you step up, absolutely and I also advise you to be authentic however vulnerable it will make you. Would you care to comment?",1

First, the abstracts called Rights and Privileges are singularly, exclusively Western or White ideas.  The very idea of an inalienable Right is purely a White Man&#39;s concept.  No other group, race or culture ever in history has ever entertained such a thing, much less made it a veritable foundation of Reality.  It is non-Whites who have privileges not Whites.  Their freedom, the &quot;right&quot; to vote, to own property, to be able to share in our Constitutional Bill Of Rights, to protest and seek redress of grievances are all things that have been literally GIVEN by Whites to them.  Their freedom was with the literal stroke of a White Man&#39;s pen.  They did not take these rights on a field of battle.  They were merely gifted them by others.  These gifts are Privileges we have given them.<br>     Actually, it is Whites who have real Rights, not privilege.  Do Asians have Privileges in Asia?

We did the study on perceived attractiveness in women with different hair length.  Men like long hair was take-away and also they prefer brunettes on our study. We presented the work at a major conference and had o er 40 people stop by our poster presentation in the one hour time slot.  Then a couple of months after the conference.  Reuters contacted us to do a piece.  I gave the fellow and interview and it went up online.  This was in 2003 before social media really hit it big.  The following Monday morning my phobe blew up.  The student and ai who did the work we discussed by CNN, FOX, and Inside Edition.  We were contacted by Men&#39;s Health, Prevention magazine, and Abroad to give our study findings and a quote.  The student and I interviewed live with Fox and Friends and flew to NYC to be filmed for Inside Edition, and we must have done 30 to 40 radio interviews world wide.  <br>   I couldn&#39;t believe the public interest in this small, simple study, but people gravitate to anything related to attractiveness.  My work as a graduate students years earlier was excellent basic science that I was really proud of.  But, there was no inkling of public fascination like with the attractiveness work.  And the stereotypes fir attractive people do perpetuate benefits for people rated highly attractive compared to folks of lesser attractiveness.  I appreciated how humble and genuine this Ted talk was.  When she said she won the genetic lottery, I was hooked to this talk because she acknowledged how lucky attractive people are with regard to serious benefits and perks they have simply by bvb virtue of their appearance.  Attractive people statistically make more money, get promoted or receive bonuses more frequently,  and have more choices in mating and/or dating opportunities than less attractive people.  And for men, height impacts their perceived attractiveness and financial long term outcomes disproportionately to men of shorter stature.  In sum, she is right on so many levels, nut our society really reinforces these stereotypes and it&#39;s sad.",1

I agree wholeheartedly as I have inside knowledge on this industry.<br>3. She was at the right place at the right time and given the proper look. What she doesnt acknowledge is this beauty standard is EXPLOITED to sell items. Thats the reason for the model selections. Things are changing now and there are a lot of Chinese models on the runway because China is a big market. That being said, many Chinese go out of their way to be as white as possible. Why? Thats for a sociologist to answer, but that has been the standard raised in the global media/Hollywood et al. for a long time.<br>4. Just because she is pretty doesnt mean she is happy/have a great life.

6563,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is right about insecurities, though. The most insecure women are actually the most beautiful, however ironic. The stakes are always higher for an attractive individual, yet yes, they generally are treated better.

Then she puts on extra clothes and CONTINUES to show modeling images of herself for the pure objectification and edification of the audience. And NO you didn&#39;t transform what the audience though of you. She gets a free dress, but didn&#39;t insist on paying for it to make amends for the &quot;guilt&quot; she feels over those people less genetically fortunate than herself. She insists that Photoshopping is just a small component of the illusion, yet mentions the army of technicians, hairstylists, makeup artists, lighting specialists, clothing designers, etc., that go into the final publication imagery. Much like the acting profession. models want to looks as young and fit as they can for as long as they can and still benefit from the free gifts, constant compliments, and loads of publicity that their occupation allows.",1

Some men want to destroy them out of resentment. Some nice men never approach them figuring a girl like that wont give an ordinary guy a chance.

6616,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One thing people don&#39;t tell you about being good looking: the stares from people. Being stared at is never a good feeling. Maybe for hoes but for normal shy girls, it&#39;s the worst feeling ever. Maybe for uglier people they have to work twice as hard to be likeable, but for attractive people they have to work twice as hard to be taken seriously. People can&#39;t control being ugly just like how people can&#39;t control being pretty. Nobody asked for it, it just happened. But you want me to feel bad about myself because i got lucky. I love all people but if you&#39;re too insecure to talk to me or if u hate me for no reason then whatever. Who ever said pretty people can&#39;t be awkward or have anxiety? Just be grateful for what god blessed you with. If you look a certain way it&#39;s for a purpose. But the one thing nobody can take away from you is your character. I never understood why people brag about their bodies or facial features. Did you create it? Did you somehow have any influence over it? Well if you didn&#39;t then what is there to brag about? Being beautiful is not an achievement. It&#39;s all a test from God. If you&#39;re pretty can you still be humble and not an obnoxious loser? If you&#39;re ugly can you still love yourself and not be jealous of others? Whatever the situation make the most out of it and beat the challenge because some day we&#39;re all gonna die and all you&#39;re gonna have left is you&#39;re soul.",1
6617,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To be honest i didn&#39;t finish the video but in my opinion i doesn&#39;t help a lot for girls who has many insecurities it was just focus on her career.

6630,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bullshit!!,1
6631,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A point is valid because of its content not because of its speaker. e.g. You do not have to have an &#39;oversized&#39; girl to tell you that you should accept your body. Everyone should embrace a good value and everyone should spread that message and hence the speaker is irrelevant.

6643,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks do matter, but it doesn&#39;t mean that good looking people are always happy.

But then it turns out that after some surgery and few operations I finally get to smile like normal people, but not for long... without much experience with girls, I happen to have depression later on.. So what I&#39;m trying to relate here is, everything that we wish for could become something that we would really want to get away from in later life.

They only choose to see the privileges she has, but conveniently omit, that this profession also entails hours of torture in high heels and make-up, suffering the bossing around from photographers, no privacy, constant hunger and phobia of gaining weight, men&#39;s constant objectifying you, as it is good for their image to date a model.",1

6685,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Life hard if we being target of people because of our beauty. Life also hard when we being ignore by people because we not beauty.,1
6686,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Shes not even good looking,1
6687,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I was sceptical at first but wow shes right,1
6688,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wtf is this video. Next we will see how a billionaire would explain to a homeless man how money doesn&#39;t matter in life ,1
6689,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are everything. Believe me, I am not a model.",1
6690,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hahaha saw the title of the video..it was enough.,1
6691,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The fact that she addressed her outfit to the WOMEN in the audience tells us that its US women who judge one another,1
6692,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The point being made is that both the modelling and product industries need to change - the perception of beauty has previously come from product manufacturers/modelling agencies dictating the ideal beauty standards. The argument is that these industries need to drastically change how they pick their models as well as the product advertisers change how they market their products. Are we ready for a change and can we bring about change. Is being inclusive better for society even it means losing the edgey/glossy advertisement and is exclusivity more harmful to society overall.,1
6693,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good looking people are treated better. People who are treated better are not necessarily happier.,1
6694,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I find it funny that she puts on a thin dress and a thin sweatshirt and thinks I still wouldn&#39;t Bang her, I would, every day of the week, that proved nothing, she&#39;s still hot. That sweatshirts not going to stop people from asking her for her number.",1
6695,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything that&#39;s why her husband or boyfriend is probably gorgeous, not a 350 pound fat guy with acne who sweats every time he stands up, but he&#39;s nice, yeah she can shut the f*ck up forever.",1
6696,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I would hate to be attractive. So much attention.,1
6697,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I agree with the argument shes trying to make. But the tittle did this video dirty. It could come off as arrogant.,1
6698,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are not everything, but they do represent a genetic advantage that enables greater connection in the world.<br><br>Intelligence, health, fitness, and looks, if selected for, create the most efficient, productive human being.<br><br>Beyond that, the only thing that can become more efficient is a cybernetic being built to look perfect, never age, have vast intelligence, run faster, lift more, and never break.",1
6699,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The title of your video is a lie. You live in a made-up world. And you&#39;re a model. Stop spreading lies to make people feel good women don&#39;t need to douche it except for look f*<b>***</b> pretty and that is all,1

6732,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you are beautiful and sexy and ravishing, you get many opportunities in life. Luck is always on your side. But the pressure to continue looking beautiful is often overlooked. You are always worried about how you carry yourself, what you wear etc., and never get a moment of peace. Not to mention the threats you may physically face. I love how she said that she is insecure cause that is the reality behind those pretty faces and perfect faces. Kudos to her for actually speaking about what one feels in this industry.",1
6733,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,When I see Cameron Russell I remember my girlfriend she looks up to,1
6734,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Honestly, sorry if this is harsh, but it was a pretty bad talk. She literally got up there and said she got lucky in her life and career, and goes on to reflect in a very shallow fashion how this is unfair. She then tries to engender sympathy by playing a supposed victim, trying to claim that models like her are &quot;the most insecure&quot; women on the planet with respect to their looks. Are you kidding me? Could she have thought for maybe five seconds about the innumerable number of people out there who are obviously plagued by insecurity in their looks EVERY MOMENT OF THEIR WHOLE LIVES because they are NEVER going to be perceived as attractive? I&#39;m sorry but it takes a lot to make me cry.<br><br>What&#39;s sad is that this woman is actually quite intelligent, apparently. She graduated from Columbia with honors political science and economics. Probably one of the easier degrees to obtain, but it still requires hard work, and Columbia is not typically easy to get into. But the whole focus of her talk doesn&#39;t make sense. She&#39;s defined her whole life around modelling, but is trying to encourage people not to judge based on looks? Could her life be a more direct contradiction?<br><br>Her takeaway message is, literally: &quot;I hope we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures.&quot; Thanks for a trivial observation. This would be like someone who inherited all their money coming and doing a TED talk saying &quot;I hope we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of inherited wealth in our perceived successes and our perceived failures&quot;, then walking off the stage after making a few off-handed remarks about how hard it is for rich people to find &quot;true friends&quot; and to never know if someone is dating you for your money. And without offering any advice or solutions. Did it occur to hear that, God forbid, maybe she could not make her WHOLE FRIGGIN CAREER antithetical to the message she brought? If she thinks it&#39;s unfair she should be using her intelligence and work ethic in a different career, or using the success she&#39;s had as a platform for something greater. She literally spends like two seconds here discussing racism, for example. If she&#39;s had success as a model, go and capitalize on that and make a more meaningful contribution to society, if she thinks judgement of looks is shallow. I have no problem if she wants to be a model, but she&#39;s being completely hypocritical, so why should we pay attention to her here? Don&#39;t spend your life capitalizing on your looks, come up on stage, say it&#39;s unfair, offer no solutions or even the most miniscule interest in remedying the problem, and then just walk off, acting like you have some sort of deep insight into the injustice of the ways of the world. 1 out of 5 stars.",1
6735,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I have dated a few models. Looks does matter.,1
6736,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A fascinating talk and props to Cameron!<br><br>But the first sentence got me thinking. She says she became a model because she won the genetic lottery, which totally makes sense. <br><br>Thus, people can become resentful and jealous because she was lucky. Other people had to work hard to acquire wealth and fame, unlike her who was just lucky. <br><br><br>But that part got me thinking. How is that any different than people winning the &quot;intellectual lottery&quot;? People are born and raised into having different IQs and the abilities to delay gratification which are two best predictors of success and general well being. That means some people were just lucky because they were born with higher IQs and raised into being able to delay gratification better. <br><br>They also won a certain genetic lottery, so to speak.<br><br>A pretty interesting topic in my opinion!",1
6737,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If she look ugly she wouldnt be a model and gave this speech... Now next video,1
6738,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Money isn&#39;t everything.  Believe me, I&#39;m rich...",1
6739,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think what she&#39;s trying to say, is that all these &quot;good-looking&quot; people would appreciate it if other people would look beyond their shiny and thin legs, and more at their views of the world, their interests, their opinion on current events, etc. I also think that she&#39;s trying to reassure those with insecurities about their bodies( especially young girls, and even boys) that there is nothing wrong with not looking like the women/men on magazines.<br><br><br>This is just my point of view.",1
6740,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Trkce alt yazili olani yok mu?,1
6741,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No matter what she wears. She remains a beautiful woman and you can tell. I always do not understand why beautiful people tell that appearance would mean nothing. Just as rich people always tell us, money is not important. Nobody would come up with the idea of telling a blind person that seeing is not so great, or a paraplegic, that walking on two legs has no meaning. What a nonsense.",1
6742,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Of course Bill Gates is gonna tell you: money isn&#39;t everything,1

6745,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thanks, great video and speech!!",1
6746,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,To be totally honest it is kind of stupid to Capitalize on anything and then cry foul later.<br><br>Seriously so now She had a conscience? It is way easier to have a Conscience after you have reaped the rewards of capitalization of your natural gifts.  I really find it totally Hypocritical.<br><br>Did anyone notice now that she is Oh so pure that the sweater she put on was lower cut than her dress was?,1
6747,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i literally see more beautiful and more fit womans than her on the street everyday but how come they are not models and she is??,1

6757,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Cameron Russell is a beauty with a brain! So articulate on stage...,1
6758,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Take a shot Everytime she says UM,1
6759,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Of course beautiful people are insecure, just like anybody who has something of value. Losing is the most horrifying thing for human beings. But it doesn&#39;t mean that being ugly or average is better. She just takes too many benefits for granted. She doesn&#39;t know how is it to be ugly. Not sure what&#39;s her point here.",1
6760,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why did she mention that the photos are manufactured and then said how she&#39;s got it all easier because of how she looks? It doesn&#39;t make any sense.,1
6761,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Heres the truth that befalls us all, we all get old and become invisible.  Ladies work on who you are not based on what society says is your worth (aka your outsides) I am an average woman but I own who I am, my femininity does NOT come from what the cookie cutter version says I should be.  Once you own your truth as who you are your confidence will shine through",1
6762,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I asked an obviously gorgeous slender woman<br>Why she wasn&#39;t walking the runways in Paris and NewYork?  She replied &quot; That whole scene was very shallow and cruel and meaningless That she had been a successful model for a couple of years already and it wasn&#39;t for her. Her dad was a boilermaker and she couldn&#39;t have weighed 100 lbs. However she could swing a heay hammer hard enough to shape steal plate so she became a Journeyman Boiler maker and she still is!  Work, drink, and play with the others as well as any man! Congratulations to her!! I am retired now and haven&#39;t seen her in over 5 years. I always think of her whenever I see the beutilful ones. I imagine she earns about 120000 to 1400000 a year. Standard in the trade. Boilermakers work the very heavy steel. Makeing massive boilers and vessels weighing 100s and 1000s of tons used in heavey industries.!  I know this because I was a crane operator and had to lift and help manouver them in the fabrication stage of production!",1

6768,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes she is bless with great looks!! I am not a white tall woman !! I am an homeless person who luck ran out! I was an beautiful person 40 years ago. I was in the Barbarazon modelimg school!! My legacy ran out in New York !! It is so expensive for the photo shoot and the long hours of being photographed in the cold!! It is so costly to buy the Designer clothes! It is so expensive to pay for travel!! The list goes on and on!! There are going be times your self esteem is going to be jeopardize!! Bosses that do not want you to succeed!! Basically do not make time for your future endeavors!! Just be passionate about what you want do<br>in life.  Have a Win Win attitude!! Be the best version of yourself !! There are going to be haters out there!! Do not let thembin your life!!,1
6769,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I met a woman on Xbox and we have been talking every day for nearly 2 months. We even say I love you. I looked through all her Facebook photos and found one where she had no makeup and showed her whole body. She looks a lot less pretty than I thought. But somehow I still love her. I feel it in my chest. Do looks matter? Of course they do! Are they everything? That depends on what you want. Ive had hot shallow girls before. Now I want someone i can spend my life with.,1

6774,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"y&#39;all are completely not getting the point. She&#39;s saying that being skinny and pretty don&#39;t make any more happy than not being skinny and pretty. It doesn&#39;t matter what you look like, we&#39;ve been taught our whole lives to hate ourselves. The beauty industry thrives off of our self doubt. Her point is that beauty doesn&#39;t effect your happiness. The fact that you&#39;re treating her like this in the comments is direct proof that she&#39;s correct.",1
6775,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Awesome talk!,1

6786,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is hot and go my attention instantly..and I agree with what she says specially about construction of beauty and how its leaves people so unhappy chasing the impossible which creates the almost trillion dollar industry but at what cost?

6793,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wtf? only 27% of models were non white? well considering in america white people are about 75% of the population that sounds right on par with what you would expect...,1
6794,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I know Im in a minority when I say this, but I genuinely think she looks prettier in the normal, every day pictures she showed, than in the professional shots. Those are phony and unnatural and thats not pretty. But, I think a woman looks better 10lbs over weight, than 5lbs under weight. Just sayin.. My sister was a model and an actress. She did several movies, but what we saw n screen was not her. Like this woman said, it is created.",1
6795,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"stopping and frisking a young male black or latino may have something to do with the higher percentage of crimes committed by young male black and latinos, versus young female white chicks.  When I was in combat, fighting an insurgency, I kept my eyes open on the streets for &quot;males of fighting age.&quot;  That is because those were more likely to try to ambush me, than say 8 year old children, or 50 year old burka clad women.  It does not mean I don&#39;t respect children or women.  It does not mean children or women cannot attack a soldier.  It means in order to keep myself and my men alive, I needed to pay attention to the likely source of our demise.",1
6796,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think her message has power to it. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a clear right or wrong on this one. I&#39;m not conventionally attractive, hence I won&#39;t receive perks that come with being perceived as attractive. With her, people work to construct her into some higher standard of beauty. You&#39;d think that she&#39;s beautiful enough but really, she becomes a canvas for people to stare at rather than interact with her genuinely.",1

6802,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"WOW, this woman has got guts the size of Texas, and one of the reasons she is out of breath is because she said in the talk that it made her uncomfortable to admit she has been cashing in on the rules made by society about what beautiful means in America for a woman, and I think Jennifer Lopez and Beyonce are extremely hot but she is a model and she knows her field and  gave the number difference of white women compared to other races modeling in America, and the reason why I think she is so gutsy, it is like if you were an alcoholic and you gave a speech about drinking without having public speaking experiences, a model is not the same as an actress.",1

From my life experience, Ive always been told Im pretty, but I have been ostracized in many situations due to lack of social knowledge/ADHD issues. Ive come a long way from where I was, but I also have battled debilitating self-esteem issues most of my life. Ive thought many times that Id trade my looks for confidence and closer friendships. Im more comfortable with myself and have learned to embrace more of my good qualities, but dont think that people with looks are necessarily more happy than those without.",1

6810,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beauty can be deceiving.  However Personality is everything.  Beauty fades.  The statement &quot;A beautiful Mind&quot; says it all. The most Amazing Woman I ever met, was a near Genius, Becky.   She had a near Photographic memory.  I really enjoyed talking with her.  However, She was also the most beautiful woman I ever met, physically.  So much so, she scared people away.  I used that  to meet her.  Long story.  Its Tragic,  all too often Beauty attracts the wrong types.  But, there is two kinds of Beauty, the mind, which is by far the most important and Amazing, and Physical which can really lead to problems. Some women and men use their beauty to get what they want.  I won&#39;t comment on that.  It is too bad that the &quot;Less than attractive&quot; can be treated so differently. We are all humans, all with challenges. Your first photo, Please don&#39;t take this wrong,  I was not impressed, I am trying to be very nice. When I see beauty, I also try to see the personality which radiates but is often muted by people&#39;s first impression.   I have a saying, &quot;Beauty is only skin deep, burt Ugly goes all the way to the bone&quot;.  And, I am not referring to Physical Attributes.  Cameron, Thanks for Sharing,  it took much for you to do that.  I could not tell from the video how beautiful you actually are. At first glance, I personally was not that impressed. Please don&#39;t take that wrong. There are many variables to that statement.",1

6813,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,White women are the number one benificiaries of affirmative action and are considered minorities (Even though they are the biggest population in the US) WW have been doing everything people claim the white man does while letting their men take the heat and hiding under the guise of being women. This model did a great job exposing that.,1
6814,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I, as a black child in a predominately white school, grew up with the white girls around me getting everything: cheerleader, senior president, prom queen, etc. My black friends and I were mostly regulated to service position in our school: class secretary, treasurer, choir, band, athletics, etc. Now, 35 years later after graduation, I have come to realize something: the students with looks or athletic skills are not our leaders in the community! In fact these people are more concerned with what&#39;s in it for them, than ensuring their communities run well! I&#39;ve found the people whom I went to school with who have the greatest social responsibility and are the movers and shakers of their communities are indeed those students who were regulated to service. These people are the ones who are trying to make a difference. Good looks, in my opinion, result  in being entitled. Plane looking people don&#39;t have this privilege and have to work!",1

6837,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"put on 25 kg , stop waxing and you&#39;ll stop being insecure. Jokes apart, it is normal that a job when your body gets scrutinised every second makes you insecure. Also because those pics don&#39;t really show who you really are and hide many imperfections.. maybe these people&#39;s insecurity may also brought about by the fact that they know those shots must be photoshopped to make them good enough. I want to be good enough to be naked in front of a camera without having to rely on a team of professional to look good. If that happened I would not feel insecure. Although, being obsessed with beauty will make you sad because you can do whatever you want, but after you turn 50 there is nothing you can do (especially as a woman) to be desired. You can spend 4 hours a day at the gym... you&#39;ll have strong muscles, but you will be a middle age woman. Men like young women. That&#39;s why having a healthy body is good, but being obsessed with beauty will only bring misery.",1

6863,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
6864,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very well stated.,1
6865,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think what she was trying - struggling - to say is that you shouldnt focus on your looks, because everyone is insecure; even the beautiful ones. That you should internally focus on other things besides looks; like your intelligence, personality, education, career, ethics, and morals (not in that order). Those are truly the things that matter and will get you further and will gain more respect. <br>She will always be seen as a former model. She will never be viewed as an intellectual. She will always have difficulties receiving respect. <br>While looks are everything in the real world, they dont have to be everything to you. You dont have to let your insecurities decide your fate or dictate how you feel. <br>I think she was trying to say something along those lines but focused on herself wayyyyy too much. Like, it was 95% about her and then that one picture of the protesters in NY. <br>Good message, very poor delivery. <br>As for people who are not white being pulled over for not being white; I dont - and will never be able to - understand how that makes you feel. I can only say that it is a horrible thing that needs to end. Im truly sorry that you have to go through that. I hope that one day you will no longer have to endure that.",1
6866,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s easy for everyone to always say that &quot;what matters is on the inside&quot;, and &quot;you have to be beautiful on the inside&quot;, blah...blah...blah. How about you try one week, ONE WEEK, in the body of someone who didn&#39;t even get the chance to grow normally, with proportional dimensions in the arms and legs. There are rare growth disorders out there that will cause your upper arms, for instance, to be shorter by 3-4&quot;. You think, &quot; oh, well that&#39;s nothing&quot;. NOPE, think again. The human brain is hardwired to detect even the smallest of errors in the dimensions of the human body. I should know -- my arms are shorter than they should be, and quite literally, 95% of people notice this within 1-2 seconds of seeing me...and then they stare for as long as they possibly can. It doesn&#39;t matter that I have a pretty face, a pleasant personality, or an IQ high enough to finish a degree in Geophysics. I will always, ALWAYS be first judged by those missing inches in my arms. If just one doctor had noticed I wasn&#39;t growing properly as a child, I wouldn&#39;t now have to live this life of misery. Btw, I live in a first-world country.",1
6867,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Most women think about their looks everyday &amp; are insecure -not just models. Part of what models are is based on genetics  but it can also be in combo of a very disciplined lifestyle to stay fit, thin &amp; hopefully healthy that shines from the inside out on ones complexion -hair and skin. Its also a known fact good looking women can be targeted &amp; manipulated too because of their looks - not just them power playing their assets. She also made modeling out to not be work or challenging it is very much so like trying to get into acting -it often involves a lot of situations &amp; giving of time many times underpaid .

6869,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What she&#39;s trying to say is that looks don&#39;t define who you are. All the pictures in magazines and stuff are constructed to look a certain way but that doesn&#39;t mean she is that person and like she said you can&#39;t change a way a person looks and we should stop judging people by their looks. Sadly there are way too many dumb people on this planet to understand that,1

6877,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s funny how the comment section is merely mocking the title and there&#39;s barely a discussion about the content. <br>I&#39;m going to keep it short just to save people&#39;s time: she is the &quot;caucasian&quot; that fights for the &quot;African Americans&#39;&quot; rights. While the African Americans are the direct victims that know how much pain they are going through, the Caucasian participants are the ones that know what exactly is wrong with the racists. <br>You can have different opinions towards the matter, but the fact that she speak out about the issue while she can stay home, enjoying those benefits that come with her beauty, deserves to be heard.",1

6884,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Interesting and good points. We are all flawed and insecure at times regardless of &quot;looks&quot;. And it&#39;s not everything. Sure successful models are able make a good living at it. And it may seem that they are &quot;luckier&quot;..but we don&#39;t know that. It&#39;s a job. And in real life they are not objects. But human beings. I&#39;m not saying that she or other models could have chosen medicine or some other career. Some in fact do. And could very well could have worked as a model. As an average looking person I hope to not be envious of something so superficial.,1

6890,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you had me by first minute of the talk.,1
6891,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Being pretty is a good base to have. You could have chosen to become a surgeon or a scientist. Instead you gave looks importance and became a model...the profession has its own downside.,1
6892,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah you are a model and you do know how to do acting,1
6893,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think we should be ourselves in any aspects of our living. having a good look is really nice but  just when it&#39;s not for showing it to others.,1

She&#39;s pretty but not my type, and in my eyes, hasn&#39;t won the &quot;genetic lottery,&quot; a self-declaration that comes across a little presumptuous. The moral was not entirely clear.

6904,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She said she is the image of what Advertisers are using as the status quo. How hard is that for people to understand? I guess it proves that self reflection is a poor substitute in favor of superficiality. This model is a human who is trying to explain how superficial society is. A few hundred years ago the &#39;ideal female image&#39; was voluptuous. But for the superficial here only see the exterior. Not the human.,1

6909,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think it took a lot of guts for her to come up and speak about fashion industry like this. Because as a model, if you ever talk anything wrong about the industry on screen then it can finish your career. Very brave and motivating of her",1

6915,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think this was great for her to speak on. The topic isn&#39;t if good- looking people get treated better, it&#39;s that looks aren&#39;t everything. It&#39;s giving little girls a more realistic idea of what being a model is really like. The media in Western culture tells girls growing up that how you look is the path to success. This can be so damaging and the effects are usually life-long. It takes someone who looks like their &#39;perceived ideal&#39; to maybe make them realize looks aren&#39;t everything. We need more people like this to tell young girls and women that your brain is your path to success, not your body. The more this message is repeated, the greater likelihood more and more girls will aspire to put their energies and efforts into politics, social justice, medicine, etc. instead of constantly worrying about if their thighs touch and if their make-up looks perfect. Voices like these push against what mainstream media is trying to sell us and it&#39;s refreshing. Just because she&#39;s a model and just because she is beautiful doesn&#39;t mean she should be written off. Everyone should have a voice.",1

I know quite a few examples of not-so-good-looking girls who were charismatic and happy with themselves and trust me boys were hitting on them hard. And also true beauties who were shy and unnoticeable. Its all about how YOU see yourself. Plus not to mention that boys usually see those beauties as object to use and leave, cause you cant be both pretty and smart.

6923,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You actually said something I figured out when I was a teenager and I had to study hard because I wanted to be doctor.....i love beauty as well but we don&#39;t need at all to succeed in life. Believe me.,1
6924,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I enjoyed this talk as a African Caribbean woman. Thank you.,1
6925,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,shes pretty AND smart she went to columbia wow. it rly sucks because i feel like a lot of pretty girls get treated like they are stupid (im not really talking about just in this case but in general),1
6926,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah girl no pity from me. Would change looks with you any day,1
6927,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This Ted talk surely needed better words because many are not getting the point. <br>We have come to a place where we are inspired from &quot;beautiful and perfect&quot; girls on the covers of magazines and billboards. The manufactured product from hundreds of editors, huge amounts of makeup, high value production, etc. is considered beautiful nowadays. You call that beautiful? Seriously? Then beauty doesn&#39;t exist. And that&#39;s the sole reason why the &quot;perfectly beautiful&quot; models are insecure(with many more mental illnesses) even though they have the world at their feet; why there is still a word called &quot;ugly&quot; used for only looks in our society and even though there are so many talks on &quot;being beautiful from inside&quot;, people still strive to be the &quot;perfect&quot;. &quot;Ugly girl/boy knows the value of being beautiful&quot;. She/He is already beautiful. They are only some steps away from realisation. <br>Why do someone looks totally different in a span of some months or years even though they didn&#39;t change anything? Well my friends that is what is called realisation, acceptance, confidence, experience, love and respect for own selves. And that&#39;s my dear is true beauty and being BEAUTIFUL. It was, is and always will be a thing from inside cuz ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD.",1
6928,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s wrong. Looks are everything.,1

6932,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I notice women have deep comments on this video while dudes are basically just cracking jokes lol,1
6933,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just by the title I can say this is the worst ted talk ever..... why don&#39;t you ask some average or ugly looking person,1
6934,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,6 years later and it is still a topic,1
6935,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is a brave woman....,1
6936,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sadly a lot of your success in life is already controlled by factors you never chose. Nobody chooses to be born into a poor family, a war torn country, to be born unattractive etc. She is one of the lucky ones who has made a career largely based based off her looks, I&#39;m not condemning her either, I think anybody would in her position. Just saying that life basically a giant lottery and some people are born with better numbers.<br><br>If looks aren&#39;t everything, tall that to Albinos in parts of Africa. These people suffer greatly based solely on how they look.",1

6942,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Poor her,1
6943,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But in some society, it&#39;s so depressed if ladies don&#39;t look like the models. I saw many harsh weight lossing and extreme beauty culture happened with many Asian girls. If they aren&#39;t skinny and pale white enough, they will be bullied. I know they are some strong Asian women who don&#39;t care about looks and being successful, but the amount of extreme one is higher...and they can&#39;t be happy.  <br>I was one of them before who was trying to maintain very light weight like 40 kg. The more I&#39;ve tried to look better (way of culture), social just never pleased. I still got bullied. It was very bad teenage life back then. All my friends are underweight either and they love it. Their boys said they are beautiful. I think they are, just too skinny but it&#39;s fine coz they&#39;re my beloved friends. <br>Good looking people (for this culture) got very better life and chances, believe me, my model friend said that so. So why many ladies got vitamins or glutathione injection, do plastics surgery, skin treatments, home spa tools, beauty supplements, etc and you guys can see this kind of ladies on YouTube. You&#39;ll see very skinny Asian girls are still trying to be more skinny (much underweight than BMI and keep trying be lighter) , pale and loss weight. Because our society expects on ladies too much. <br>There are many skinny Asian idol (like teen model) on YouTube try to lose more weight, got skinny arms and legs, being more white and 100,000 ladies follow them. They smile and laugh so the followers believe they are happy because they are beautiful on the beauty standards. So the followers desire to be like them. I can feel those ladies. <br>Now I&#39;ve change and gain weight when it&#39;s almost too late after I was underweight for almost 20 years. The social said I&#39;m not on their standard, too fat, ugly, too heavy, lazy, etc. But I feel happier. Much happier. Look is still important to me, but it&#39;s my way, my standard, not other&#39;s or culture&#39;s standard now. <br>I understand the point she&#39;s trying to say. But we can&#39;t save other girls&#39; souls   because of the depression surrounded them. <br>Medical research paper here said ladies here have eating disorders by depression environment so they feel hurt inside and bring to illness. <br>But this beauty standards has never been changing since 1000 years.",1
6944,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There are a lot of catwalk and catalog or store models, etc., who are not even very pretty, but they are chosen for their height, shape of body, hips, legs, breasts, even shoulders, how photogenic they are,a number of reasons. There are so many tricks of the trade that can make people look beautiful today, but it means very little if they are not beautiful inside, because that&#39;s what shines through! Looks fade in time,are NOT everything, there are a lot of pretty orhandsome people out there who have nothing upstairs in the skull!! Often modeling is not lasting. Have a back-up!",1
6945,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,unique person,1
6946,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you got anything other than her saying it isn&#39;t fair that people who don&#39;t look like her( pretty, white, skinny) being treated differently, then you are just a negative Nancy. Period.",1
6947,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I can see both sides of the argument on this video and technically both are right. On one side its good people like her are coming out and saying that she understands how lucky she is and how its not all perfect, she mentions she is insecure but so are a lot of people who aren&#39;t good looking, maybe that&#39;s the point?  But also remember she benefited greatly from modelling as anyone would do in her position. Heck she modeled for 10 years! I see why others are angry, modelling from what I have heard tends to pay well (not sure in the beginning though) and doesn&#39;t seem to need any qualifications, if you look the part then you&#39;re hired. She mentions traveling and getting stuff for free, all the things most people don&#39;t get to benefit from. So in reality looks do help and without question most would choose to be attractive to get all those benefits.",1
6948,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I mean this also applies to Instagram models, both this lady and them have one thing in common: insecurity. Cindy Crawford herself said &quot;I wish I looked like Cindy Crawford&quot;.<br><br>Because both models and instagram models have to worry about their looks, the slightest imperfection can be worrying. I got into the habit of posting instagram photos without any photoshop because I knew if I constructed that image of myself that I would come to hate how I actually look, and maybe that&#39;s part of the reason why despite severe acne, I don&#39;t feel too insecure. No filters or beauty apps. In addition, I have a partner who finds me attractive and loves me even when I&#39;m not wearing makeup + all the acne scars. If I could find him, you too can find someone who will find you beautiful as beauty is so subjective.<br><br>Now, I admire her admission to how standards of beauty, at least in her industry, are based on race. She seems to be very wary of herself and how she has an edge in the industry unlike some people that are too prideful to admit it. I don&#39;t believe she, however, that she should be blamed for it as there are beautiful people in the world regardless of race and colour who are simply overlooked by the people who are hiring models in the first place. This model was so young when she started that she most likely never realized the racism in the fashion industry until later on. I do, however, think she should have elaborated more on the struggles that models have in the industry that people may not know about. Being physically attractive can call for a lot of unwanted attention and people who base attraction solely on looks vs personality and compatibility.",1
6949,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is such a beautiful soul though, isn&#39;t she?",1
6950,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So... then she gave up modelling to be happy but poor? Nope. It&#39;s great to see things from the inside, but not sure what the point was. We all know models are insecure, abused, constantly hungry and a product to be shaped. But she&#39;s still doing it, to the best of my knowledge. She&#39;s still choosing the perceived &quot;unhappiness&quot; of her career because it&#39;s lucrative. So it can&#39;t be <b>that</b> bad or she&#39;d give up!  Clearly an intelligent and sensitive young woman, with much more to offer the world than her body.",1
6951,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"her carrer is for sure changing , before or after this ,idk, but i feel  she d given up",1
6952,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Easy to say all that when u look like her.,1
6953,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Besides the fact that women age like spoiled milk and easily loose that beauty is also the fact that a pretty face and body with no personality is tiring and easily bwcomes ugly,1
6954,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Black women of model age in America make up less that 3% of ALL people... Of that 3% maybe .01% have the looks to be a model.. Of that .01% maybe .0001% actually want to be a model.. SO, THE 26 BLACK MODELS OUT OF 700 WHITES ARE NOT UNDER-REPRESENTED.. that are statistically OVER represented..",1

6959,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"a more appropriate or less controversial title for the talk would be  &quot;the downsides of being a model&quot; but that probably wouldn&#39;t attract so much views. <br>so if it&#39;s attracting a lot of negative comments, she can only blame herself for putting out the click bait. <br>well, attractive people do tend to know how to attract attention.",1

6963,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks aren&#39;t everything but they definitely are a p big something,1
6964,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lets clear the air here. Looks arent everything, but attractiveness can play a large role on how youre treated. As horrible as that is, its true. Yes, models know theyre beautiful, but in the model industry, there are standards of beauty that must be kept up with. Though they may be more attractive than the average person, they still, compare themselves to other models looks. People simply want what they dont have. Anyone can feel insecure. On a superficial level or not. Everyone human on Earth has different qualities that are better than other peoples. Also, free things may be nice when youre beautiful, but people are quick to judge and make assumptions about your life simply because of your looks. No one likes to be misunderstood. A beautiful person may have a rough past, but its assumed that your life must be great, because youre gorgeous. So before you make another comment regarding how shes wrong for feeling a certain way, try to put yourself in her shoes, even if shes on the better end of the spectrum.",1

6967,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you actually watched this video and have negative comments about it then you&#39;re part of the problem she is referring to...  It&#39;s refreshing to see someone speak truthfully and insightfully about one of the greatest lies being sold to our society - that being attractive and white makes you better.  She&#39;s calling it out and saying it&#39;s not true and it&#39;s not fair.  She is admitting that she&#39;s part of a problem that has been built and created more than one that is natural.   This lie she calls out, being white and attractive makes you better and more worthy, has caused so much suffering for anyone who doesn&#39;t fit that description.  The tragedy is that instead of viewing advertising manipulation of images with a more critical lens, we continue to glorify the likes of the Kardashans who have no claim to their fame  other than having money and good plastic surgery.  The majority of young people in this country, in the age of social media, are experiencing extensive anxiety, body dysmorphia, loneliness, depression, and more mental health issues at record levels.  If we could scrub the images being sold to us as desirable and if we could start to honor those with good and kind hearts more - emulate the compassionate rather than the vain and shallow, the world would be a better place for everyone.",1

Until she walks in the shoes of someone who is, someone who probably has been given rude comments and ugly stares, then her opinion might change.  She has not gone through that.  She will probably get the comments when she begins to age and that is when she will realize she had an awesome life she never enjoyed because of her silly so called insecurities.",1
6973,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this is like a rich person saying money isnt everything, to you maybe, because you have it you dont understand the value youre just used to it.",1
6974,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thanks for your bravery Cameron,1
6975,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hi from Turkey. I would like to tell you especially, that you arent seem the person you describe. I watched your ted talk and I realized that its so easy to produce philosphy about life for rich people. You say women are under pressure about how they look like because of fashion industry but you still doing modelling. Why dont you quit and protest this industry? Vs doesnt hire any fat model and you walk for them on their stage. You are justa fucking liar who seems worried about people. good job",1
6976,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The US is 70% white. This factor could be affecting the ratio of models on stage..,1

If you had a different career or you switched it, I would get it. &quot;I lived that world, but it was so fake&quot;. But you are STILL a model.

6980,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are valuable, but only if they are the true image of you, ie no makeup or surgeries and such.

6981,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything? Yeah right. Tell that to a girl who is not tall, stick thin, pale, and not bleach blonde and tan who wears glasses. She isn&#39;t one to talk.",1

6987,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So you are telling me looks arent everything. That would be true if the following question did not occur: A beautiful woman does not have to do anything to have a partner or to find a husband at the end. She can just stand there and men will talk to her and finally seduce her. But what are the chances for a less beautiful and shy man? And I am not even mentioning those people who suffer from harder challenges or disabilities, which life had brought onto them. Can I just stand there and wait to be dated? Or can I be sure to ever find a partner? No I cant. Believe me I have been most eagerly working on my personality, on my look, on my impact on other people. But I still cant stand there and get hit on by women automatically. I am still failing to find a partner. So at the end I have to say, that looks are everything, because if you have none, you will be doomed to die alone.",1

7003,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah. Weird speech,1
7004,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yeah but being beautiful is better than being ugly . Leaving aside all these theoretical &#39;everyone is beautiful, beauty is in the inside&#39; motivational speeches You get treated better when you&#39;re good looking, you get more attention to be heard sometimes even if it is a subject that hasn&#39;t much to do with your face. You have less chance to get bullied for the way you look or told things that affect your confidence (and yeah , I know that beautiful people get these problems too but nowhere near what society labels as &#39;unattractive&#39; deal with . <br>So, I don&#39;t think &#39; A beautiful model&#39; is the only side to hear when it comes to that. It&#39;s like Extremely rich men talk about how money can&#39;t buy happiness (well yeah money isn&#39;t Everything, But having money is still better than starving, or being poor, or struggling on a daily basis to have a proper life.)",1

I think, its human nature to notice what is pretty first, and then notice the rest, if they have a chance to.  Thats not a bad thing as long as we remember that theres more to a book than its cover.  I always notice attractive people and sometimes tell them they shouldve been a model!  Fortunately, Im not jealous of attractive people, but admire at how good looking they are.

7029,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Pardon me, you have not transformed in front of us in 6 seconds. You simply showed us you can change your draws like everyone else. And you dare compare yourself to a thoracic surgeon? You must be very special, eh? An Insecure narcissist. How splendid.",1

7031,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People who are commenting this and bitching about how &quot;looks do matter and how dare she complain because she was lucky to be beautiful and beautiful people are handed everything and can&#39;t have real issues in life&quot; are part of the exact problem she is highlighting in her talk. Oh the irony.,1
7032,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you are a great catch! enjoy the ride!,1
7033,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Is this the girls that was the most beautiful girl in the world?,1
7034,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Proud of you,1
7035,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Back in 2017 i was as fat as a hippo and now im as thin as a pole. I never saw this vid but everything she just said is true. Skinny women get treated better.,1

7038,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Never ever worry about your looks, because it neither matter to those who love you and to those who don&#39;t love you. So, what&#39;s the need of worrying :)",1
7039,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are not everything but trust me when i say this it make a huge diffrence! EVERY singal study has reached the same result.,1
7040,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love being unprivileged. I want to achieve everything myself.,1
7041,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nothing new but it is one more voice by this term.!,1
7042,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you weren&#39;t a good looking person,and was in position where you are right now and were taking about this then i would have agreed.",1
7043,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To all those commenters who spouted something along the lines of &#39;looks are everything&#39;/&#39;look at the pretty girl complaining about being pretty&#39;. Here&#39;s a story for you. I have a friend (really, it was not me), who was dating an extremely pretty girl. Far prettier than Mrs. Russell. She worked for a larger local company in a non-modeling capacity, but they still used her photo in advertisements and company literature. She was just that dam good looking. But bhe had no interests, not much of a personality, wasn&#39;t funny. After only a couple months my friend broke up with her. Her, quite amazing, looks just weren&#39;t everything. A couple years later my friend married a much less, by comparison, attractive woman. They&#39;ve been married for 15 years, have two kids. He&#39;s happier with the less attractive woman, because the less attractive woman has more of a personality. Looks aren&#39;t everything.",1
7044,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Truly the &#39;best&#39; things in life are those that you&#39;ve worked for. Mrs. Russell nails it when she says she &#39;won the genetic lottery&#39;. This, I believe is the real reason so many &#39;pretty&#39; women are so insecure. They didn&#39;t work for their beauty. You know how we treat our star athletes, we honor them, we worship them, etc. etc.? How would feel tomorrow if you woke up and everyone around you treated you like you were the greatest athlete of all time? Remember, you aren&#39;t an athlete, you&#39;ve never won anything, etc. etc. But people let you cut to the front of the line, the smile when they see you, they buy you drinks, etc. etc. Now image how you&#39;d feel after a year of being treated like the great athlete, again, you haven&#39;t ever competed in anything. You know you didn&#39;t do anything. You know you haven&#39;t &#39;earned&#39; any of this special treatment. You also know that others around you aren&#39;t getting the same special treatment, and many of these people actually are accomplished athletes. After awhile this starts to mess with your mind. Some will feel guilt, for they understand they&#39;re getting special treatment for accomplishing nothing. Some will fall prey to hubris and start to actually believe they are the greatest athlete, although deep down they&#39;ll always &#39;know&#39; they are lying to themselves. Knowing you are &#39;false&#39; leads to insecurity. What if people suddenly find out you&#39;re not the greatest athlete? What if they stop caring if your the greatest athlete? What if you are given a promotion at work, based on you being a great athlete, and you are put in a position that&#39;s above your head? If we get back to winning the genetic lottery and talk specifically about beauty, insecurity is also generated because at some point you realize you&#39;ll get old and the beauty goes away. When the beauty goes away the free ride goes with it. It&#39;s like apressure cookerof insecurity, slowly building pressure as the years tick by. While it&#39;s hard to &#39;feel sorry&#39; for really pretty girls, I do. Seeing anyone who&#39;ll never be judged for the content of their character, or their actual accomplishments, etc. It&#39;s kinda sad. A perfect example is this video. I think Mrs. Russell did a pretty solid job. But I&#39;m betting a lot of the clicks on this video were because of her looks. I bet a lot of the viewers will mostly remember how pretty she was, and not really what she said. And if you read through the comments, you see quite a bit of hate/jealousy/ignorance in response to her looks (not what she said).",1
7045,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful people get unwanted attention and get poorer every days they age. Some people are beautiful but empty and some plain people become beautiful from knowing,1

7051,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, I&#39;m sure those fashion models are so unhappy in their lives with those expensive clothes, hi end parties, traveling around the world, fame, etc, etc. Let&#39;s set up a charity to address their insecurities.",1
7052,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Best ted talk ever,1
7053,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I do agree that looks aren&#39;t everything....but also I can not take this video serious being spoken by an amazingly beautiful woman.This woman doesn&#39;t know the struggles of having a face that guys don&#39;t look at twice.Having the face that guys look at and then keep walking as if they never even saw you standing there.I know she is a good person trying to do and say the right things,but she will never understand having a face that people have considered ugly.",1
7054,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I trust her . Because she so beautiful ,1
7055,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She had more to say. A lot more.,1

7058,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this is such an amazing speech :) it changed my perspective on caring about looks and everything and Im so glad that i watched this xx,1
7059,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Maybe I would say that looks are not everything, if I was pretty like her.<br>But video is awesome, of course",1
7060,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Of course she doesnt think beauty is everything, she doesnt know what it feels to be called ugly multiple times because she&#39;s beautiful",1
7061,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Love love love love..thank you for these beautiful words ,1
7062,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel that she is stressed  and breath  with difficulty and that makes me nerve,1

7066,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"OMG, she&#39;s an amazing human being!",1
7067,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Well I think most people are just very disappointed when attractive people are also smart and caring people who are honest strong and don&#39;t like being used or abused because that is the stereotype associated with physical beauty.,1
7068,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; is to models as &quot;money isn&#39;t everything&quot; to millionaires.,1

7071,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"so being white, attractive, heterosexual, cisgender makes life easy mode for a woman, and for a man too, although then intelligence might be on the list of useful qualities. And if you wanna change that, you gotta actually use ur brain which will never happen in society.      better start on that list or accept failure i guess.",1
7072,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Brilliant talk. Honest and well delivered.,1
7073,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,In my opinion she is expressing the idea that we are so much more that our looks and that we can achieve anything we want in our lives. She wants to pass on her experience so that we can do something of more value. She speaks from experience and I think from her own regret. Bravo!,1
7074,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"being ugly sucks, ask me, being reminded about your hideous looks everywhere isn&#39;t cool. I was even suspected of being a thief at one time,",1
7075,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,All she did was brag. No message and waste of time.,1
7076,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s trying so hard to make a joke.. but people are too buzy flirting,1
7077,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was very uninspiring and now I feel guilty because I&#39;m white,1
7078,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,...I would love to see the people in this comment section fulfill a ten year modeling career see if they still think that girl is complaining for nothing.,1
7079,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is very nice looking seaxy,1

7083,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,YT ads are the worst OMG,1
7084,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I see a few &quot;ugly duckling&quot; stories in the comments.  I have experienced the opposite.  From my teens through my 20&#39;s, my world-view was that everyone was kind, nice, compassionate.  I crossed 30, gained weight and looked nothing like the apparently handsome young man I was, and suddenly strangers were not nice and kind whenever I met them - they often glared at me, or worse, ignored me entirely.  It took a few years, but I figured it out.  People were kinder to me as a young, slender, good-looking man, and as I aged and gained weight, their unconscious programming told men and women alike that I had no value and to either hate me or ignore me.  Society is fickle.  Looks are fleeting.  Our harsh society judges us all instantly upon appearance.  Young?  Old?  Attractive?  Unattractive?  Influential?  Wealthy?  In a split-second view, we all consign each other to our respective pigeon holes.  I&#39;ve begun to lose weight, by the way.  And with each new burst of weight loss, the world is suddenly friendlier to me - more smiles, more &#39;please&#39;, more &#39;thank you&#39;, more people holding the door open for me.  It makes me angry, actually - all of these people, who several months ago would not even acknowledge my presence are suddenly being kind to me again, and I hate the hypocrisy - I am the same man, I just now have a different shell.  We are all so petty.",1
7085,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This TED should be watch for so many girls suffering for what they think they should look like...thanks,1
7086,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,WOW!!!! I hesitated to click on this but boy am I glad I did. She was phenomenal even in her nervousness.  All young girls should hear this speech.,1
7087,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she is absolutely beautiful and has a great way of holding the talk. But what she says is, well let&#39;s admit it: nothing, zero. Which confirms what she said, however.",1
7088,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I am an ugly almost bald headed indian guy....unmarried....ask me if looks matter or not.,1

7098,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is beautiful women inside out &amp; stood by her words marrying someone who is good at heart instead of going by looks. You can find the profile below of her husband<br><a href=""https://instagram.com/damanibaker"">https://instagram.com/damanibaker</a>",1
7099,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Despite the nervousness she showed, I really appreciated what she shared . I think models, despite their beauty and fame has problems like normal people do.They also have insecurities.",1
7100,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She changes her outfit and still looks amazing,1

7104,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Can i like something 3 times,1
7105,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I personally disagree with the amount and content of the negative comments under this video. Yes shes a model and yes shes had luck on her side for most of her life. Why should that take away from what she has to say? It takes actual bravery to speak up the way she has, especially when so many people could respond negatively; but she did it. Shes also shown that although she is privileged, she acknowledges it. Shes not stuck up about it and she doesnt take advantage of it. Shes using her voice to raise awareness for those who determine most of their worth on their outward appearance and I dont think thats anything to criticize.",1
7106,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Negative comments are from non humans, keeping  low energy VIBRATION flowing.",1

7113,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Work as a farmer in any of the tropical countries in Africa or Asia and then check your skin color if it is still white or check if your hair still shines. The white people are usually found in cold countries where the Sun is not very harsh and they buy most of their food from Africa, Asia and other central American countries. When people don&#39;t have to produce food and just buy and eat ready made food and don&#39;t get exposed to intense sun heat will of course stay white. That&#39;s how white race has come into existence. If a white person stays in tropics for his entire life and his kids and their kids then their white color will slowly blend with the color of people who are living there. It&#39;s not the race that makes a person different, it is the place where you live or from where your ancestors are, is what makes you different. And of course whites enjoy this beautiful gift to dominate other races.",1
7114,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not something that I didn&#39;t know already a long time ago.  But I never wished to be a model or to look like one.  I&#39;m happy with myself and appearance.  Good for people who are not happy with themselves and for people who judge only by looks which is sadly A lot!,1
7115,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Honestly I am not sure what she was trying to get at with this... The title of her talk did not match what she was saying,1
7116,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Best Ted talk!,1
7117,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Are we supposed to feel bad for her? I am so pretty I&#39;m only wanted for my looks. Boo freaken hoo!,1
7118,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes it is. I only like this guy cuz the way he looks and now i honestly cannot forget about him. He IS nice and friendly and surpringly not cocky, but the only reason why i started liking him is he is hot. The only reason he doesnt like me is because im not good looking. Thats life",1
7119,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You&#39;re amazing honest and humble and thats to be admired but your white guilt is unnecessary.  You don&#39;t get stopped by police because you&#39;re pretty, you dont get stopped because you&#39;re statistically less likely to commit a crime. Also. Genetically speaking your white, light coloring is quite rare in the world, and sought after because so. So feeling guilty that there arent more dark skinned models is unnecessary. Dark people make up over 80 percent of the world population. What is rare stands out.",1
7120,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,the exact opposite of this video is Letter to my son from Jim Jeffrey stand up. it&#39;s such an irony...,1
7121,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If models are so insecure because they&#39;re worried about how they look because they&#39;re constantly scrutinized by photographers and they don&#39;t get a chance to develop themselves in their chosen profession why don&#39;t they choose a different profession? Is someone forcing them to be models?,1
7122,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The world its change now,1
7123,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks certainly are everything to you,1

7131,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She should have mentioned that her pretty face also allowed her to be on a TED talk without having anything special to say. It felt like sitting while my family was showing their hollyday pics. I don&#39;t see the point of this TED, it&#39;s complaining about the drawbacks of her job while she was never forced to do it.

And ive met people who were not that attractive in society&#39;s standards but they have a beautiful heart and honestly that makes them even more beautiful than those people who looks beautiful on the outside but is ugly on the inside. So looks are not really everything!! Your heart and what your character says about you is the real deal. No matter what you think you look like or what other people thinks about you. Just make your heart the most beautiful thing about you and people will see you beyond your looks and it will take u far.  And I think its beautiful when people start looking to a person&#39;s heart than by just merely looking  on the outward looks. <br><br>Just my thoughts! :-)",1

No matter what, we&#39;ll feel unsatisfied, that&#39;s a fact, that&#39;s because we are human beings.

7185,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The reason there are more white people in the US /UK magazine she mentioned is because the population in the in those countries are mostly white.

She does a job where looks are everything and she has to compete with a lot of people in terms of looks. And being a model does have it&#39;s dark side. It takes alot of courage to open up like that. Looks might be everything in this society, but that doesn&#39;t mean society is right.",1

7221,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Was fr einen Mist erzhlt sie??? omg,1
7222,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"My younger brother was on the books of a French agency when younger (literally walked in their door on passing one afternoon, and out on their books, just a little later - and how could I forget that he was dressed in tee shirt, torn jeans and needing a shave - I remember as well that just a little before signing him he was asked if he could make a casting for a particular client, next Tuesday?&quot; which wasn&#39;t a problem and voila! BTW, the less tall one was, by comparison, no more than &quot;what the cat dragged in&quot; for all she cared about me... Nor am I complaining, just a fact!),  yet he was always reticent to admit being one, to anyone he ever met. To those who met him, should anyone ever suggest &quot;you should be a model&quot; he just returned a wry smile and nodded a &#39;maybe someday...&#39; kind of nod back. Even that wouldn&#39;t make him admit. He feared being instantly stereotyped as either unintelligent or unusually vain. <br><br>Being not as tall as him, made a huge difference, in the dating years I can absolutely and unquestionably confirm that fact for sure. He could attract girls, back then, in the same way that the rest of us go down to the shops when we&#39;re out of milk. He just couldn&#39;t understand it when I would go on about how so few were willing even to give me a chance. I had a similar face, but it was those 4 inches of height which ensured that 6th winning number in &#39;the genetic lottery&#39; - where every single number, bar none, must hit industry requirements, or you will have next to no chance of having that much envied life where you can attract the interest of most others without much problem. yet then fear telling them that you&#39;re really just a model, who is paid to show up and take directions when called for. Frankly, it&#39;s not just the female models who are insecure, in other words. And, I might add, with very good reason; discounting, of course, the very few who are so vain, they might tell themselves &quot;what others think is what others think... etc.&quot; <br><br>The irony of it all, is that while you enter on looks alone, it&#39;s ultimately all down to either the client&#39;s own taste, or what clients want at  each casting, which is all that matters. So someone who appears to have it all still might not get booked - despite months of turning up for castings, simply because the look client was seeking each wasted ime, wasn&#39;t yours. Anyone who is in any way insecure will find this very difficult, at least some times.<br><br>:PS - I had to add this. Modelling is about the only job where you don&#39;t necessarily need to be &#39;discovered&#39;,  at many agencies you even don&#39;t need to show up for a formal interview to be signed, nor even need a book (photos of your previous shoots) with you to be recruited,  and in some cases, it really could be just your self and anyone else accompanying, in off the street,  whenever you could be bothered to visit, will be enough to become signed. Never pay for test photos up front - if you are that rare that you have it you have it. And any agency which charges prospective models for photowork before signing is almost certainly not worth the time of day.  Looks are and alas will be the only currency which matter inside those doors, and for the rest of your comparatively short career. No references needed. Not even timekeeping references! Dress to impress? Forget it. <br><br>BTW, anyone who can&#39;t make the gigs, won&#39;t get rebooked, as after looks tick all boxes, a reputation for professionalism is what matters next. Also, just as in real life, where some people wouldn&#39;t find a supermodel attractive and viceversa, each agency has varyingly different requirements in the looks dept., to the next. So, prospective models could give up disheartened, after being rejected by 5 in a row, without realising that the next three could just as easily want to grab you! When I knew about this, it worked this way but I&#39;ve no idea if it&#39;s the same or any different now - when much younger I witnessed similar in two different countries) If you&#39;re what they want,  you could turn up, whenever you like, and ask to see one of their bookers, casual as you like, in teeshirt and jeans, and the receptionist will either look at you, and say something like, &quot;sorry our book&#39;s full here, you could try another agency...&quot; OR, will say this (which is, or was..., good news) &quot;could you take a seat for five minutes please&quot;, after which the person with arguably one of the few better jobs in the industry will stride from nowhere, and do their stuff; chances are, you will be walking out not too long later, as good as signed with them, before you&#39;ve even walked out. What people likely envy about it all, is that there is (bar all nepotistic roles) no other better paid job, which requires no cv, no references and no need to dress up, at any pre-arranged time just to be initially signed, either.",1

She says it, she&#39;s insecure. <br><br>It is not fun to be attractive, and not do what you are thought to do or be, or have done to others that look like you that did to them years before you even knew them. What I am saying is, is that I am a woman slightly over 6 feet, long, and slim, attractive physically at times in photo&#39;s, in person, and I have always been judged harshly. I also age very slowly, and has been medically proven through my teeth.. I have done everything to hide myself and the way I look in baggy clothing, no make up, and weight gain.

You did well clearly. So persue your mind now. Ive seen this same insecurity in a number of women I persued - yes because they were beautiful. My 2 cents - they never had to cultivate anything else and after all the attention starts to subside they crumble. This is kinda sad. So again feed your mind it does wonders for your confidence, also if I may, SUPPORT YOURSELF! dont allow yourself to be dependant upon anyone but yourself. This is what true freedom is.",1

7242,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"@Sophie Sakura  &quot;Those pictures of models are Photoshop lies and it makes me angry. It is an attack on the minds of young people&quot;.  Lmao No it isn&#39;t. The purpose of modelling is to promote &amp; display clothing products, pose for photography and provide a visual aid for artists. It&#39;s no secret that many pictures of models are photoshopped so it&#39;s stupid to refer to them as &quot;lies&quot;. If there are young people who are dumb enough to be influenced by these pictures then that&#39;s on them.",1

7251,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,To me she aint that sexy or hot......sorry guys but its what i really think,1
7252,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So. Maybe to clarify. She&#39;s not saying who might have it harder. Or think and sympathize about the  subtleties of the rich and beautiful. But explaining that our culture has praised looks and seldom genetics thereby making it a rigged system. And there&#39;s no way to change it other than to find happiness in the incredibly vas world that isn&#39;t the entertainment industry and to stop composing and comparing our lives with someone that&#39;s always going to have it good. Because being beautiful isn&#39;t purposeful. It&#39;s only beneficial... Anyone going into marketing, I&#39;m sorry, but you are destined for eternal hellfire.",1
7253,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Honestly Im glad that shes told the truth and risked a career-ending move to just put the brakes on this perception that racism doesnt exist, that people arent treated differently. Im glad shes chosen to use a privileged voice to speak out about the issues that matter. Im also worried that you can line up Ted talks based on viewership and find the same skew toward videos featuring the whitest and most traditionally attractive people... particularly the media based ones. Finally, despite all of her claims of understanding, shes completely failed to address that having the thinnest thighs isnt really a good thing. People die more often of being underweight than overweight. Most models are underweight by far. As she said, most models when theyre hired arent even old enough to have dated yet. We need to talk about child exploitation, representation of children as sexualized, and of women and girls as potential victims or deserving of abuse in this industry.",1

I didnt think I was pretty, But in later years, people started saying wow youre very pretty or your outfits are amazing. It became embedded in my mind. I started dressing only to impress people. I would constantly be uncomfortable because my bodysuit was too tight or my sweater was too itchy, but it didnt matter, because I looked pretty, right? In grade eight it fell apart. People had evolved to saying you are going to be a model and I could only reply But I dont want to be a model. They would walk away confused, how can someone who looks like that not want to be a model. I was self conscious, I liked my body, but I didnt like my mind. My mind would say that I was too boxy or my prepubescent breasts were too small (as they should be). I was trapped.",1

I have seen many beautiful women being lonely and depressed and many not so atractive ones being happy and more positive about life.And the opposite of course .Beauty helps but isnt everything.Most powerful women in the World rich and appreciated are not models ,they are not even beautiful ,they are regular looking women (Opra ,Ellen de generis ,Angela Merkel ..)

It doesn&#39;t matter that she was nervous, nor that she has remained a model, even though it is not as great as career as some people imagine it to be. She&#39;s already looking forward, as she has tuition money saved for college. How many models have gone to college after their short career is over? I like this Ted talk.",1

Women are beautiful and sometimes we are just trained to be insecure, through society, and social meida networks. If we are confident about it some people get intimidated by it, but I think I love make up because it is fun to experiment with it, it&#39;s a hobbie, and sometimes guys don&#39;t understand it, and over think it, but if it makes her feel healthy and it brings out her joy and spirit, that&#39;s a good thing. I think girls should take pride in their hobbies, and passions, when they do this it builds character, as long as you like it, but if it doesn&#39;t there&#39;s always an option to find another path. it doesn&#39;t mean men are not gorgeous either, sometimes there so gorgeous that I forget what I&#39;m doing.",1

7349,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just happened upon this talk. I watched about 4 minutes and that was enough. How dare she be the victim; to suggest her looks are an albatross is to negate the real suffering many women and men go through for reasons too vast for her vapid brain to handle.,1

A very complex and deep topic brought to you by one of the most attractive people in the world.  I hope this gets a trillion views.",1
7357,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I read the comments before watching the video and I highly regret doing so. Most of the comments I read were negative so I was expecting to not like what I was about to watch. I was completely wrong. Im so glad she shared her story.,1
7358,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There is no point of being salty and judgmental. For what its worth, she is one of not so many privileged people who actually admits that she is and clearly is grateful for the opportunities she has been given. She inherited the legacy of being beautiful and thin, and even if she wanted to, she could never undo it. It was an utterly powerful speech with all the nervous laughs and stumbles. Trying being a model in the industry where youre constantly judged by your looks and rejected when those looks arent up to scratch and still remain such a compassionate and kind person that Cameron Russel is. Beauty fades away, but being a decent human being is long lasting. I wish everyone who is reading this a great day and send you some positive vibes!",1

7362,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is when you stop watching TED videos... LOL at the people who think looks don&#39;t matter.,1
7363,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She really spoke the truth. We all know there are stereotypes out there in which some benefit and some do not. Its the way of the WORLD. She was brave for coming out and speaking so candidly about her experiences. Great talk!,1

7382,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I always lose interest when white people start blaming their own skin color and bemoaning about the oppression of others IN white areas. Does anyone go to Rwanda and complain their &quot;blackness&quot; is oppressing local Chinese? Or their standard of beauty is oppressive to Brazilians? No. No one has told the rest of the world to hold white people to some sort of higher standard.,1
7383,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I just wish I could get to know her more. She seems like a very intelligent person, very cultivated, and very responsable.",1
7384,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How is she saying it&#39;s because she is white. All skin colors are accepted in the industry and we white people like to have darker skin. And it makes sense that most of them would be white because it&#39;s mostly a white country,1

7399,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel like she needed so much more time. The conclusion felt so disjointed from the flow of the talk,1
7400,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good job on your talk, really appreciate it",1
7401,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I still find myself wondering if she&#39;s one of the pretty one&#39;s who doesn&#39;t go for really good looking men, just because she can. And that&#39;s just because I&#39;m not that good looking. So I, as a not particularly good looking man, am still favouring &quot;beautiful looking&quot; women over not so &quot;beautiful looking&quot; women. It&#39;s a trap that I didn&#39;t make, but I see it in front of me and then walk straight into it. Worse still, if I make a decision not to go for looks, expecting to therefore get someone who is &quot;nicer&quot; in some way or other, then I have shallowly judged &quot;pretty&quot; women as not being so nice. Even knowing all of these pitfalls, when I am out for the evening, my gaze will still fall upon a pretty woman, and a pretty woman&#39;s eyes will still look straight though me and come to rest upon my friend, who is better looking than me. The small cold comfort  I have is that I&#39;m sixty and the whole silly game is soon to be over for me. I wish I&#39;d been strong enough not to play. I have known people who were.",1

7406,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just like money, looks are an asset! Do not underestimate the power of good-looks. They do help out a lot, if you are smart enough to put it to use! Just like money needs to work itself by investing it smartly, looks too can take you places and bring you things that an average-looking person (especially woman) can never have!",1
7407,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think she looks sexy in the longer dress too.,1
7408,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
7409,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You know the matrix has to be restarted if people are saying that pretty white females are the result of racism and that it thus is a bad thing.,1
7410,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She really pisses me off,1
7411,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I have request to TED .<br>I watch your videos sometimes<br>I feel there should be subtitle,1
7412,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She was nervous, i believe in a more comfortable setting she would have been able to express herself differently. You guys know what she was getting at right??!? Even though looks matter in this world it is deceiving and not just in a superficial way. In a nutshell,  stereotypes being applied to you/others can cause people to react/treat you in a certain way, that doesn&#39;t determine who you are. She is saying not only is it hurtful/harmful but also your outside appearance does NOT define your own character it also does not define others. The more you can accept that fact you will start to understand you can&#39;t look at someone and know their worth, their thoughts or even their character. She said i am insecure however from the outside she has it made but the inside may not reflect that. I love this! beautiful sis and if people cant see the meaning of what your are saying they need to listen again. <br>And just to add something to the mix when people said its like the rich people saying money isn&#39;t everything, well its not! Why do you think so many people with money have drug problems or commit suicide; its the soul that needs the surgery and money cannot fix a broken heart its just a bandage thats not sterile. The wound will get infected with time. I truly believe real love for life will bring riches<br><br><br>Also reflecting on my comment she went even deeper than my statement expressed. these preconceived notions that put some people at an advantage is not right and other people need to feel included as well. Wow honestly we are not ready! Too much grass is greener to fully penetrate our socialist views with this concept. And too many people not wanting others to see their side of the fence in fear of their grass being trampled. Honestly many people have said what she is saying time and time again but they way she nervously fumbled around brought a innocence to the subject as well as it was almost like a puzzle for the soul. Maybe thats just me ",1
7413,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Amazing!! Thanks for sharing your life and views!,1
7414,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Perfect!,1
7415,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am not sure what was the purpose of this speech, she proved that looks matters, and that she feels bad about others, less fortunate. The &quot;it&#39;s not me, it&#39;s a construction&quot; stands in opposition with her looks, she looks amazing even without pre- or post-production.

7416,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I guess by her logic doctors also won the lottery since they inherited smart genes, are also a white majority (at least in the past) that must be racist right, or is it because America is about 80% white? I guess all the professional hockey players (being mainly white) are also privilege and won the lottery (I wanted also to say football players but that sport definitely is more balance as far as race is concern,(unless the Mexicans are wondering why there isn&#39;t an equal representation for them in that sport, I guess they didn&#39;t win the lottery on that one. She does pay in a way doesn&#39;t she. Every time a  male looks at her, he is gratified by her appearance wither she likes it or not? Maybe she feels she always has to be nice because cute girls don&#39;t get mad and show it right? You get the point I think, she pays, she pays.

However, in both cases, you get your hands (and the rest of you) dirty. Oh, and you might get some REAL stress dodging gangs in the ghettoes.

We&#39;re telling people to be allies. To raise awareness. Then someone does, and they&#39;re still not good enough because they&#39;re not &quot;one of them&quot;. They&#39;re judged for not loving the &quot;gift&quot; they were given, when all they&#39;re trying to do is say that it&#39;s not really a &quot;gift&quot;, so that people stop idealizing something that is causing a lot of harm to themselves and others. This is why progress fails to happen. Instead of allowing someone to lift us up, we try to cut their legs out from underneath us, when all that person wanted was for us to all be able to stand on our own.",1

And people who blame society for all kinds of crap, remember that society is nothing but a collection of it&#39;s human components. Your height, weight, race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, class, nothing is a good enough excuse for any person or institution to make you feel less-than-sufficient. To all the insecure folks out there, not just girls, FOLKS!!!.....remember you are BEAUTIFUL FIRST AND FOREMOST because of your thoughts and actions and character, everything else comes later. And never look for outside validation, because people are neither wise nor kind enough to judge you. Only YOU can judge yourself. Don&#39;t go to gym or eat healthy because you want to look good for someone else, do it for your own health and happiness. Don&#39;t dress a certain way or wear makeup to get compliments, do it to for your own enjoyment. And believe me, when you&#39;re happy with yourself and refuse to be otherwise, haters will move off and you&#39;ll be able to attract the right kind of crowd. And no matter how hard life tries to put you down for good, rise, and rise, and rise again, because you can and because you owe it to your amazing self.

Elle n&#39;a pas  se plaindre de devoir toucher un homme pour une photo alors qu&#39;elle est encore jeune et vierge.<br>a a d lui faire un bien fou de se confier de monter sur scne de parler d&#39;elle de enfin prendre la parole de parler de ses privilges mais aussi de son inscurit !

She&#39;s not used to speaking in front of tons of people, &quot;why.&quot; like she said, she was made to sit there and look pretty. So obviously what she said was gonna be different from the usual TED talks. But it still made a point.",1

7490,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This speech was well searched but the only thing it lacked was organisation.... The conclusion could have been better.... but she portrayed her ideas and feelings in the minds of her audience very well...

7491,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The data on % of white models vs other models is totally meanigless. Did you consider that maybe because the fashion Industry is biggest in the West countries, which happend to be mostly white, the beaty would be definied by the majority?

7494,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So inspire,1
7495,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think that her main message is that white privilege and the perception of Western beauty go hand in hand and that the ones who tend to embody that particular image the most, are sure &#39;winners&#39; of the current game. Even though any and everyone else CAN win in their own way by their own means/devices along with perseverance that will ultimately build character, it&#39;s a given that only certain people WILL for sure &#39;win&#39; based on certain factors and will maybe not have to work as hard as those who aren&#39;t apart of the perceived vision of &#39;beauty&#39;...interesting... In short, the world that we currently live in is very shallow and superficial but THAT world/state of mind will slowly draw to an end and when it does, we will all be standing on ground zero to eventually usher in the next age where survival of the fittest will rule. People will eventually draw to each other more so with vibrational frequency rather than physical attraction. If anyone wants to survive, do like TOOL suggested in the song nema; &quot;learn to swim&quot;.",1

I have reached the point to work from home and have very few friends...",1

Like basically &quot;Just lol xd look at me I&#39;m white and rich lol some pedophiles said I was sexy at 16 and wanted me to pose for underwear&lt;33 lemme make some jokes so TED will want me here to stay and keep talking sh*t about what other people don&#39;t have.

People might not even notice that they treat you differently they might say they dont care but you are seen as a more likeable person,funnier,smarter just because they like your appearance. And studies have been done and a lot of this is proven . Just imagine a life where you are born ugly and a life where you are born beautiful.

Something way more important like a scientist, photographer (something I even enjoy doing!) etc. The answer is, girls grow up KNOWING that looks are EVERYTHING. Men too, but girls especially are forced to focus on their looks from very early on. She is right about that whole ideal beauty being the tall white woman.. When I was 5, I wanted to be a white girl with blue eyes and blonde hair. My parents never taught me that was pretty, it&#39;s just society who did. The only kind of women I see on billboards. I still think it&#39;s so easy for her to talk, she does not walk outside being confronted all the time by the fact that she does not fit in the beauty standard, she will see herself or someone like her on a billboard.. Whereas, I&#39;m even too scared to look at them anymore because it ruins my self esteem even more, from whatever little self esteem there is left. I can say for sure that I would much rather be in her shoes, many girls will choose to be the model instead of the boss from Vogue.",1
7546,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Believe me, I&#39;m a model.&quot; This rather gives people a reason not to believe you cause it&#39;s so easy to talk lol<br>BUT, I think models are victimized in a different way. Exploitation at a young age, and maybe even BDD because of the harsh and strict conditions in the industry that is not appropiate for any child. Modeling should be for 20+, that way we can get that unrealistic ideal &quot;looking like a child&quot; the world out too. It makes no sense when a 16 year old poses for Dior, or any other brand meant for adults. We shouldn&#39;t strive to look like &quot;barely legal&quot; teens.",1
7547,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The truth is, you can make a lot of money just by the way you look and vice versa - you can improve your look even significantly, if you have sufficient amout of money.",1

7561,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wha wha.. her struggle is real..whatever.,1
7562,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s an excellent truthful speech delivered by a nice intelligent woman. A lot of people are instinctively accustomed to expect only shallow, foolish remarks from women working in this industry. It&#39;s nice to see that not only does she prove all those people wrong, she actually tries to help those who think themselves down on their luck concerning their physical appearance by showing the world that there is more to public success than meets the eye.",1

7566,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Shes right looks can start the game but they dont end it what a person is on the inside is the stuff that matters and dispite the fact the every person in the world has flaws and insecurities we still try to be perfect, we just dont make any sense",1
7567,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She seems to think being a model is a lot cooler than I do.  I like short voluptuous girls.  She has a nice face but I wouldn&#39;t date her.  A model to me just means someone that is too lazy to do something that requires thinking,1
7568,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"let me just say this now, shes invited to the cookout",1
7569,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Some years ago when I was young and thin but plain and mousey, I permed and bleached my hair blonde and bought a red sports car, got excused from a speeding ticket twice without saying a word or even batting my eyes.

7576,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I appreaciate it but I think she should have spoken longer and deeper for people to understand the point of her speech. All I got was she is beautiful and insecure, and average people shouldn&#39;t really care about their looks cause it&#39;s not that important.... uhmm",1
7577,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank u,1
7578,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Very good. This lady is much more than her pictures suggest.  The strongest message for me was the &#39;same day&#39; pics when she was young. She was a real person being presented as something quite different. Very good speaker.  Bravo.  I would imagine she&#39;s had a lot of men take an interest in her when they were very unsuited to her intelligence and personality, men who only related to her looks.",1
7579,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I was never remarkably attractive in any period of my life. Being a guy I dont mind as much because as guys we arent pressured to look good as woman are.<br><br>However I never was frustrated because how others see it. Its mostly when I look at the mirror and see photos of myself and think Ill show him,1
7580,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"1. So basically, because the West is composed primarily of white people, it is the duty of the model industry to push more &quot;persons of color&quot; down the runway. Makes hella sense.<br>2. We can&#39;t be anything. That&#39;s a lie from the self esteem movement. You use whatever talents you are given to live a successful life. If your beautiful, use it. Why should she (the speaker) tell people to not follow in her footsteps?  Being a model is a pathway to success. Why does she overlook this?                                                      3. Racial profiling? Really? Oh gee, I get to here a model lecture me on racial profiling.                                                                                                                                                       4. And then the white guilt. The LEFT&#39;S pretend masochism and virtue signaling.",1

7587,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,shes beautiful,1
7588,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She could have kept that dress on, I still would&#39;ve seen the same human being...",1
7589,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I can&#39;t decide that what was the main message of this talk. Scientific researches proves that (sadly) look does matter.  A LOT. Especially at first impressions. Better looking men and women can achieve more goals in life just because of their symmetric face or good body. And we all know that right? Life gives us these examples every day in our workplace, in the queue, etc. what she also mentions.<br>I don&#39;t know why did she mentioned the frisked  issue with black and latino men.. This seemed a bit SJW attitude for me and that&#39;s something that I can&#39;t stand, sorry. If you mention something which is dealing with races, please prepare a more detailed speech, because the lack of the information leaves a wrong/side conclusion in less informed viewers about races and stuff.<br>In my opinion, this talk was short and contained so much mixed information what need to be explained more in the future. And I missed the main point of the talk.",1

7591,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I like her I support her but damn wtf? She didnt even explain anything she DIDNT say how she got her first job.. very brief..I would have liked to hear more seemed incomplete..,1

Without knowing who the Columbia graduate that I previously stated was, it&#39;s safe to assume most people believe this person can be of value to society. But being &#39;pretty&#39; by society&#39;s standard is also supposedly valuable as portrayed by media, right? She said it herself, when little girls tell her that they want to become models when they grow up, she asks them, &quot;Why?&quot; In our society, pretty people get is easy, but that doesn&#39;t make you any less valuable.

7598,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a load of bs. So what! Shes cash out now telling the rest of us that she feels insecure! And dont go after modelling jobs! Well then why did she do it for so long then if she was so unhappy?!!!,1
7599,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very interesting,1
7600,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The title could be &quot;looks aren&#39;t happiness/self-confidence&quot;. But she also touches a lot on how it&#39;s unfortunate to those who are not privileged, which is a slightly different point to make, and she did not make her point of her talk clear, although it was good and she is brave, etc.",1
7601,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,White dudes dont like it whenever people point out racial inequalities. Not talking about it only keeps it thriving and its time to confront the issue so we can all move forward. God bless cameron russell.,1

7609,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I got it through this video that Cameron wanted to say: &quot;People, we should realize that we shouldn&#39;t judge on looks!&quot; <br>With that, as more people would get it, there would be less problems for less or more beautiful people! In my opinion there are no ugly people, at least on the outside. It&#39;s easy to change your look nowadays, so you who look on the outside can be easily tricked.",1
7610,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really apriciate when people tell the truth. She is so brave and honest.,1
7611,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good looking ppl live life on easymode while average looking and also ugly ppl struggling with it on hardcore,1
7612,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
7613,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s a catch 22 If  you&#39;re pretty, people get jealous of you and don&#39;t look deeper than how you look they just see how you look so you go living life thinking  NOTHING that  you think or say really matters. It sucks! And if you&#39;re ugly people are mean they don&#39;t want to be seen with you and you  get  looked at like you&#39;re NOTHING and your opinion also doesn&#39;t get taken seriously.   also really sucks! My point is PEOPLE will judge you no matter what so just be kind respect yourselves and others be the best that you can Ask God for help if you need to.  Looks are just like a shell it isn&#39;t who you really are and shouldn&#39;t matter as much as who you are as person how well you see and treat others.",1
7614,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks do matter, if your ugly nobody will care about you and if your good looking every single guy and girl would be coming to you talking to you, that is the truth believe it or not.",1
7615,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is very true we are more than just our outside appearance....ha ha I don&#39;t care what I look like....people who care what they look like need to get a life and look at the real issues in this world.,1
7616,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She kinda proved that looks ARE everything...,1
7617,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Honestly who cares about the whole non-white thing it&#39;s ridiculous it&#39;s what the world ones what the world likes it is what it is,1
7618,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If you had a car accident or whatever that destroy your face and lose lots of money  then you probby won&#39;t be here on the stage and say hey the looks and money aren&#39;t important bullshit.  Your talk is purest bullshit.,1
7619,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is inane. This girl has no depth and she is grasping to try to make this topic interesting. Obviously young girls struggle with body image obviously you are judged for How you look including race. This girl is a horrible choice for a speaker,1
7620,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A few of these comments are very insightful but for the majority of them I have to wonder if the person commenting even watched the video.,1
7621,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron says, Gender and racial oppression=MSNBC Brainwashing",1
7622,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This woman&#39;s talk was so spot on. Many of the commentors got her message completely backwards.,1

As I grew up I learned how to get dressed and do my hair and make up, I became very fit and my face turned out to be so pretty. Now people treat me better and try to get to know me. I hear the word you are beautiful every day. So dont tell me beauty is not essential to having a great life.",1

Seeing her like this I realized the true meaning of looks is not everything. Before I always thought that shes so lucky, she meets all these good looking guys, they are crazy over her and then I realized that she was just a girl who got dumbed by this jerk and that every other ugliergirl has been through the same.

Lots of money to cover the cost of fashion. To be perfectly honest tho, I do not think ugliness exists with in appearance. The beautiful people are most likely beautiful due to a habitual life style, derived from rich parents. Fortunately the human anatomy does not differ greatly from person to person and if you can learn to optimize it, beauty lies at everyone&#39;s finger tips, that being said, so does aptitude, intelligence, creativity and physicality. For example, it might be cliche but its true, pretty woman are dumb but the power to be smart lays dormant with in their own minds, simply because they dont need to be smart.<br>You heard her say she was given a dress because she didnt have the money.<br>Enter stupidity, maybe its forced by society or maybe pretty people accept it?",1

7674,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It IS everything. Because it gives attention of super males and gives super high quality mating opportunities :) and extra beautiful children as the result at the and of the day (year) :D,1
7675,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is Brave to talk full truth!,1
7676,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is easy for her to say looking like that.  If she woke up one morning looking like Rebel Wilson she&#39;d be on suicide watch!,1
7677,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So what I learned is I need to be better looking.,1
7678,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Informed, aware, innovative and intelligent. Brilliant talk!",1
7679,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I have respect for you. Fashion industry thrives on people telling that be insecure about yourself ,you are not good enough",1
7680,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What I took from this is she thinks white privilege is a thing and it is ABSOLUTELY NOT. What an idiot.,1
7681,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,es ridiculo que una mujer haga un speech diciendo que la belleza no es todo cuando ella ya tiene la belleza y aunque sea una tarada o creida la sociedad la dejara encajar en cualquier lado,1
7682,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She needs Jesus. And she&#39;s not the first to admit to having everything and still be insecure and unhappy.,1
7683,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this is complete bullshit. Look matters the most in this world. People like u, listen to u and give u everything when u r tall, handsome or pretty. Personal experience. <br>This girl just got money and fame based on her look and now shes talking bullshit look isnt everything ? TED talk is just bullshit",1
7684,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Leave it to a good looking person to say how much looks dont matter lmao.<br><br>Its like a millionaire saying to a bunch of poor people money doesnt matter,1
7685,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People get so angry when its about looks.<br>Her message is, physical appearance is superficial, dont ever look at someone and compare yourself or think youd be happier if you look that way. Dont let other people change how you feel about yourself. Always be happy in your own skin.",1
7686,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This sounded like a bunch of SJW stuff. Some people win the genetic lottery, be happy not arrogant. No need to apologize for it its extremely annoying and disingenuous.",1
7687,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very well said!! Honest and Sincere.,1
7688,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I am very handsome. I understood what she was saying. Looks are given out based upon nothing. I just read what I wrote. Sounded stupid...,1
7689,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Her point about LEGACY is deep.. this was built for the white views and what is beautiful for them. Very discriminatory. Because people view beauty very different around the world, for example my country we find skinny tall women unattractive.",1
7690,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In my twenties I had so much negative persecution just because of my looks. Queens can be vile creatures. I wish I had had more confidence in myself back then. I would have called them out on their unwarranted vitriol. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses,   qualities and attributes.",1
7691,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"And she&#39;s right. They gave her 9 minutes and 30 seconds to talk. There&#39;s a video about how you&#39;ll marry the wrong person and that frikin got 22 minutes. Daamn, Daniel.",1
7692,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Put my thoughts into words.,1
7693,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Even with the change shes cute,1
7694,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything. Says the girl who has had people hand her things her whole life based on looks.,1
7695,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s all about the money <br>It&#39;s all about the dum dum didudumdum<br>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s funny <br>to see us fade away <br>It&#39;s all about the money <br>It&#39;s all about the dum dum didudumdum<br>And I think we got it all wrong anyway,1
7696,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I know!,1
7697,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;I&#39;m a pretty white woman,&quot; typical white mentality!",1
7698,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Never heard someone making more sense.<br>I don&#39;t knew who she is<br>Now I know she is a model<br>She is really sensible,1
7699,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nice talk,1
7700,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Haha only outside,1
7701,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I always say, &quot;If only our outsides matched our insides...&quot;",1
7702,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is great. Heres what I interpreted. Being the &quot;ideal&quot; look is to the utmost beneficial financially and socially. The ideal look is to be of light European decent, male or female. Looking this way for her personally gave her a career, financial freedom, free passes from offenses, and social acceptance from just about everyone. The cons are insecurity and being seen as someone who is the opposite of who she truly is. I like how she mentioned the biases against others for what they look like. Black and Latino males are truly ostracized by society because of the basic norms that are taught by the dominant color. Lol funny way to put it.<br><br>My opinion....Everything she said is true and it brought up all of my emotions and experiences of my own life. Read on if you would like.<br>Im a black educated female and it is taboo for many that both can coexist. Black? And a university education without affirmative action? 4.0 gpa? Deans list? Paying out of pocket?<br>Im black and said by many pretty. For many others, it is taboo that this can also coexist. Pretty and black? WHOA!!! I cannot count the number of times I have heard, you are pretty for a black girl. Its horrible that it has been said so much by so many that is has caused those that are light in the black community to look at dark girls and tell them that they are pretty for a dark chick.  Huh? For real though? Colorism needs to cease! <br>I am told all the time that I should be a model for my looks. I have gone to big cities like Miami and Chicago and have been asked by actual models if I was one too. I am not one btw. Because of my looks, I get free stuff (food, clothes, technology) and compliments just about everyday but she is right, it is definitely not peaches and cream. As already mentioned, I get ignorant comments about being smart, pretty, and black all at once. I get unwanted touching like butt grabs by strangers (I was actually threatened to be beaten by a man who I told to never inappropriately touch me again) and unexpected shoulder massages by coworkers. I get rude stares by other women, untrue gossip by jealous people, and hated by women for looking this way. I had a few bullies in HS that I never even had a full conversation with; they hated me for my looks, my style, and the fact that others liked me for it. I am also insecure, I see in black culture that thick thighs and big butts are in. I see that big hips and breasts are in. Long bouncy hair and straight white teeth are in. Well I have gaps in my teeth and coffee/tea stains. I have small hips, long legs, a small waist but with a big booty. My bf calls it slim thick. But definitely not thick like the video girls though! I have short kinky curly hair and 90% of my body resembles that of a skinny white girl with this models body type...so in the black culture, I feel less than everyday because my body type is not ideal to them. In the general society, many men dont give me a second look regardless of prettiness because I am black. Many only give me a second look because I AM black and they want to know how it is to be with a black girl.  Dating sucks because people always want to be with you for the wrong reasons. <br>Okay here is my point....There are many pros and cons to being what you are, NO MATTER what you are. She has pros and cons for being the ideal human, I have pros and cons for being me and so does everyone else in life. But as long as you stay true to WHO you are, dont worry about anothers opinions about WHAT you are. It may hurt you financially or socially for a little bit but keep pushing and the bully at the top will eventually give way. I am a strong black female, I dont care if someone pushes me , I will push back until they stop.",1
7703,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m not sure what the point of this was. It just seems like she feels guilty about being beautiful. She did graduate from Columbia, and stays in excellent shape. That part takes work.",1
7704,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lol you people are so bitter.,1
7705,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel like shes downgrading all models!  Yea its not a career but it builds confidence.,1
7706,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Says she&#39;s white, but has brown skin and brown eyes.   hmmm",1
7707,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I literally get discriminated for my lack of beauty, it feels terribly... I dont understand her.",1
7708,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"For us mere mortals who didn&#39;t win the genetic lottery, every little bit of good looks counts.  Before I gained 20 pounds, even being in my 50s I was considered a hottie and had lots of attention.  I gained 20 pounds and bam, instantly lost much/most of that admiration from so-called friends.  Now when I&#39;m out and about I get ignored 85% of the time whereas previously I often got looked at.  It&#39;s amazing to me really how different I am perceived now.  I am the same person on the inside.    10/12/18.",1

7720,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That&#39;s true looks aren&#39;t everything in this life and the sooner the better we realize that the sooner we will be better people ,1
7721,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Do you know why pretty people say that looks aren&#39;t everything? Cause they&#39;ve got nice appearance and they know that feeling when you&#39;re beauty, but, for example, unloved or unhappy. Rich people got money and that&#39;s why they understand that there are a lot of wonderful and invaluable things like health and happy family. Don&#39;t judge her if you don&#39;t know how it feels.",1
7722,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The more emotionally attractive a girl is, the prettier they appear.",1
7723,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is saying that images are photoshopped and fake, not real persons. that being model isn&#39;t what you think when you look her. She sad important things and I respect her. beauty isn&#39;t crime. I love how she changed her image on stage in minute ^^",1
7724,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"brilliant vid . Below is an extreme essay about some of the few topics in the comment section. Don&#39;t judge me I was bored. Everyone is at a certain point to be fair.<br>(Note there may be errors or what not. But grammar Nazis are not welcome so be gone)<br><br><br><br><br>Then I went to the comment section where two types of people dwell the positive and the negative.<br>Allow me to point out some things I spotted in the comment section and simplify them.<br>Indeed we all have heard the &quot;looks are not everything&quot; . This is true. Personality and other factors &#39;should&#39; be at the top of the priority list without a doubt . Of course aesthetics play a role to a certain degree but let&#39;s put it into a situation. Let&#39;s say a person isn&#39;t particularly attractive based on your preferences but had many more positive qualities, there should be a compromise to a certain degree as to weather you&#39;d start a relationship with them or not. In today&#39;s society that&#39;s not the case, most people are judged strictly on appearance nowadays and people who are supposedly &#39;unattractive&#39; usually are not given the chance to show their other qualities to make up for what they may be lacking. The word it&#39;s self &#39;unattractive&#39; strictly depends on personal preference as well since &#39;beauty&#39; can be something very different depending on the person e.g what one may see as unattractive another may see it as attractive. Media is designed to influence people on what attractiveness looks like or just simply show what the majority believe is attractive, in reality it&#39;s just down to preference and most people would do well to make compromises in appearance for other characteristics but unfortunately most humans are not like that and blame biological traits or whatever that bullshit is ( your a human with a complex brain and capable of making decisions not based strictly on biological traits fucking use it ). compromises would allow anoyone to have a chance with anyone they wished instead of being completely rulled out due to appearance. If people were willing to make compromises and not judge people on just appearance the world would indeed be a better place.",1
7725,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Look aren&#39;t everything but yourself is already everything just stop being sarcastic woman.,1

7739,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,white guilt.  Sad.  She is beautiful and should not apologize.  She could be a homeless derelict and she&#39;d still be beautiful,1

7751,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s not even that attractive, I&#39;ve seen girls in my school hotter than her. Plus she doesn&#39;t look 100% white, could be a light-skinned mexican/middle eastern or southern european. I guess that&#39;s the point she&#39;s trying to make, her modeling pictures look hot but they don&#39;t look like her.",1
7752,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Models are insecure about their looks&quot;.  But somehow they insist on friends and dates who are only as good-looking as them.,1

7759,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Says the skinny white woman that promotes that construct,1

7761,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well yes, thin tall women are supposed to look fragile and insecure (and they are often infertile)... supposedly it is a sign of feminity, mostly in developed cultures. In tribal cultures, it is thicc women with huge breasts and buttocks that are considered feminine (and androgine looking women, unfertile, therefore unfeminine). <br><br>All cultures have a huge degree of sexism, sadly. There have been also matriarchal cultures, though... and trust me, women in power are not less oppresive than a man.",1
7762,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very interesting... she raises some really good points on how society&#39;s view on looks can be detrimental to a person n how well they do in life...paying a cost for what u look like n not who u are... very interesting....,1

7767,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I applaud your courage and bravery to share the ugly truth unapologetically. You stood tall and provided the accurate mirror that people are reacting to, the ugliness and shaming we do among and to each other in our society. You owned your inherited &quot;wealth&quot;, acknowledging the suffering that occurs in everyday life due to the illusion which the modeling industry, including any media-created &quot;construction&quot;, breeds and sustains. I hope you continue to grow and foster the empathy for others, as you are, with as much grace and honesty as I saw here. Keep sharing your stuff...heart to lips. Thank you.",1
7768,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The fact that there is a speech delivered on this topic ironically proves that looks <b>are</b> everything.,1

7774,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I am impressed by this talk. She knows her privilege. She acknowledges that being white and pretty has given her an unfair advantage over other people. I wish that all white people would acknowledge their privilege so that they see and acknowledge the disadvantage experienced by black people everyday of their lives.,1

7784,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is the first TEDx talk I&#39;ve seen that was a waste of time. She wasn&#39;t funny or educational. I don&#39;t know how she got on stage. There was no take away from her talk. She just talked about how fortunate she is (where she&#39;s only about an 8/10 and not much of a celebrity) and then threw in 2 racial statistics. All she did is reinforce the stereotype of models that she meant to speak against - so cringey.,1
7785,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Easy to say for someone whos pretty. She wouldnt trade her looks to be average looking.,1

7808,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,we love a woke queen. I love you for that. thank you for acknowleding your privilege and using your platform to bring light to other issues.,1
7809,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I always had this idea,1
7810,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I relate to her!... I am so glad a naturally Blessed beautiful woman stood up for women like she and myself !..  In today&#39;s world it has become that only fat ... Unattractive, short... women are being given every self confidence and basically an &quot;affirmative action&quot; for all these much more common found average to less then average women...",1
7811,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am blown away by this girl&#39;s presentation. It is the perception presented to us that a person so beautiful cannot be so brainy. The world is presented to us like that, and the only way to change it is from the inside. Cameron Russel, please run for President of the United States. Even if you do not win, you will pave the way for others like you to be accepted as more than just a pretty face",1
7812,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"no doubt looks give a person an additional advantage ,For a model like her looks are everything but of course you are not preferred just on basis of good looks in other professions ,beauty can not save you if you lack knowledge and emotional intelligence in a certain field .",1
7813,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"when you are beautiful, other women hates you for no reason, stares at you on a street and say things that aint even true and men just wanna F you and know you just because they want something from you...we are souls that have a body, not bodies with souls....",1
7814,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What was the point of all that talking,1
7815,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,another white person preaching white people are bad,1
7816,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think I know where she&#39;s getting at. At first, I noticed she was really nervous from the way she laughs and breathes, and the look she&#39;s giving to everyone. She really showed that insecurity and for her to admit that even though she&#39;s a model is quite amazing. She may be a model but that doesn&#39;t mean she has the greatest life ever. She showed humility and care from people she doesn&#39;t even know. I&#39;ll give her 10/10 for that.",1
7817,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What shes saying is looks have huge effects in our lives, but it shouldnt be <b>your</b> everything. Like, just because youre pretty doesnt mean you dont have insecurities. That is basically what shes saying. This is coming from someone who suffers from bdd. Im ugly af and that is all i think about every single day. I think pretty people have perfect lives. Or thats how i feel, atleast. Thinking about this logically, theres no such thing as a perfect life. Everyone has something they dont like. I guess thats what shes tryna say. No need to be rude yall.",1

7827,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,great talk,1
7828,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I need more!!!,1
7829,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One thing: people still cheat on anyone no matter what they look like. If they cheat, they cheat on anyone. She should do a video on a list of disadvantages because there are many. Another thing is they never know who wants a relationship with them for the reason that they like them for who they are. They will be hit harder than others with the change in people&#39;s attitude towards them when they get older.",1
7830,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is fucking amazing ,1
7831,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So if you&#39;re attractive, people will be attracted to you. Amazing insight.",1

7833,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,can a black guy do a ted talk about dik size not being everything?,1
7834,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Well of course looks aren&#39;t everything. Everyone knows that unless they&#39;re real dimwits. But looks help A LOT in life.,1

7836,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s brave for saying it. I hope everyone here understand that looks don&#39;t define a person. Don&#39;t go hating on people just because of the way they look or because you feel insecure.,1
7837,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So many missed the message. <br>Good video.,1
7838,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful,1
7839,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sounds weird but reminded me of a person I know he has a disability but when you look at him you can&#39;t tell. From the outside he looks &quot;normal&quot; he constantly get judged and ridiculed about why he doesn&#39;t act  or dress like all the dudes, follow society rules. making him feel low esteemed. His disability is physically he hides it well. <br><br><br>But he truly has a beautiful soul but bcuz he doesn&#39;t look it. Ppl and women pass him off as ugly. <br>Judge a book by its cover is is reality for him",1
7840,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She seemed full of anxiety; her nervous little laugh really started to annoy me.,1
7841,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,yikes,1
7842,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Brilliantly said! Well done. <br>Being on a platform where people can shout out their opinions without consequences I think is gonna give you lots of negativity but Thank you for doing this. Actions speak louder than words and you standing on that stage spoke volumes!! So thank you :),1
7843,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was educational &amp; eye opening.,1
7844,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you an eye opener.,1
7845,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t any thing that&#39;s just something ugly people say,1
7846,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very powerful!,1
7847,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is so sweet and funny, but it is really sad and beautiful how she talks so honestly about her own vulnerability, and about the bias that people have.",1
7848,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I like her honesty. She doesn&#39;t have to apologise just because she is beautiful. The biggest critics of other people&#39;s looks are usually individuals who are themselves far from good looking. Most of the beautiful people realise appearances are superficial, they are above it, simply they don&#39;t need reassurance in this area. On the other side many ugly people want to prove they are not the ugliest and will happily make a snide comment about other&#39;s appearance, because themselves have problem. That&#39;s my experience.",1
7849,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Really great talk.,1
7850,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She has a talent for speaking on embarassing topics properly, I&#39;m sure some NGO with a semi-taboo topic (say &quot;stop prisonner rape&quot; or &quot;unchained at last&quot;) could use her.",1
7851,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Cool stuff she said but it didn&#39;t really connect or have a clear point,1
7852,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Love her ,1
7853,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She makes valid points, albeit fairly obvious ones. I think we are aware that attractive people get a leg-up in life. It may seem shallow, but we are genetically programmed to be drawn to people that we find attractive. I trust biology on this, even if it doesnt always seem fair. Btw Cameron is considered attractive in the US, but in other parts of the world she would be considered too tall or too skinny. Beauty standards vary across the world, and thats fine.",1
7854,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow the fact that she can stand there and admit the truth.. this make her even more better.,1
7855,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTAQvldnijkYup"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTAQvldnijkYup</a> looks are everything in this world",1
7856,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Do you think confidence comes with attractiveness?,1
7857,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Came here cause I thought this might help me become and feel less conscious about my looks and focus on better things in life but this comment section triggered me even more lol.,1
7858,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,did she say something?,1
7859,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yaa ok i agree looks are&#39;nt everything bt wat if u r short also like me m feel very bad wen i look at myself in the mirror m only 5.1 or 5.2,1
7860,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lian vv..you took the thought right out of my mind.<br>There are those who speak of their preference in regards to being beautiful on the inside..instead of just on the outside.<br>The fact that they judge Cameron and others just like her..and suggesting that she has no beauty on the inside because she only has superficial beauty externally.. tells me just how ugly they are on the inside, simply going by the unecessary &amp; nasty comments.<br>Truly spoken by pure  ugliness through and through.<br>Congratulations on exposing yourself !! ",1
7861,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Shes hot but why is she so out of breath,1
7862,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Puts on a peasant skirt, flats and a sweater...and she&#39;s still smokin&#39; gorgeous.",1
7863,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Really surprised and impressed by her self-awareness of her privileged life.,1
7864,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I can put into words how well thought out this TED TALK was. Best one Ive seen yet  Thank you for bringing her on ,1
7865,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She should have also said, Image is deceitful.  Welcome to the world of advertising!",1
7866,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The talk is only 9 minutes and she spent 8 of them bragging about how gorgous she looks.,1
7867,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good discussion,1
7868,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She really did a great job explaining how model life is!!!when you are pretty ,people hate you,give you look just because you look a certain way they dnt understand!it is very difficult to walk into a big cafeteria where everyone will look at you &amp; you have to pass the hallway all alone!!it took lot of courage from me,it was tough for me!!",1
7869,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"being tall and white has absolutely nothing to do with the &quot;legacy of beauty&quot; standards for women.  In fact, being tall is considered a negative for woman.  Being slim is also not genetic to any great degree, it&#39;s primary a matter of watching your diet and exercising, things pretty much every model do religiously.",1
7870,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I have two gorgeous girls..I told them they were not allowed to be a model..it does not make you feel good..it tears you down..and it makes you feel like you are not good. than you for this Ted Talk...,1
7871,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=6m42s"">6:42</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=6m56s"">6:56</a> so it is about how you look",1
7872,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m pretty sure this is one of the most useless ted talks ever... disappointed. A LOT. It was quite shallow and non-inspiring and not very clever. And all those &quot;honest&quot; parts are things, that are already talked about, so not even there some much needed truth and authenticity shone through.",1
7873,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Problems of a rich white female model . What a huge problem she has .,1
7874,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wonderful, honest talk, I wish more people were aware of how privileged they are.",1
7875,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Oh god she&#39;s so intelligent and wonderful ,1
7876,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Actually tan skin. Light skin isnt as valued as tan skin,1
7877,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You&#39;re a model. That&#39;s why i don&#39;t believe you.,1
7878,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What a crock of crap.  I consider myself engineering support.  Do I go around wondering if I got my job because of my race or color?  Actually sometimes I do because I am a mixed race.  Do I go about feeling guilty and wondering if someone else should have the job?  F-DAMN NO, if there is anyone better at what I do then the people I work for will do so.  Trying to implement this fake racial divide is not helping anyone.  If this girl feels that someone else should have her job.....maybe she should let them.",1
7879,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s not a big beneficiary of gender for chrissake she is a woman. Her whole career is her objectifying herself and that&#39;s supposed to be a privilege? How fked up is that?,1
7880,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was a excellent video for people that actually bother to listen. She didn&#39;t say looks do not matter but rather looks matter in a superficial way. She was trying to point out how fake and contrived a lot of the world is today and that she is a normal person on the inside with fears and insecurities just like anyonelse. If people bother to listen they may accidentally hear what she has to say.  Congrats to her for a great Ted talk . It took a lot of courage for her to give it. I&#39;m a fan now because she was honest in sharing !,1
7881,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Barbara Palvin should do a TED talk. People will watch it like drooling dogs even if it&#39;s about hemoglobin or something.,1
7882,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think this was a excellent video. My hats off to Cameron Mitchell. She gave a talk that took ally of courage on her part to give. Being beautiful may make some parts of life easier but it also makes some parts of life much more difficult. Most great looking people are insecure or at least that&#39;s been my take away from the ones I have met. They obsess over how they look 24/7 and are really self conscious about everything they do in front of people known or unknown. It&#39;s like they live with a ton of stress every waking moment.  The beautiful people that learn how to be honest such as Ms Mitchell have a healthier   Less stressful life and do adjust better when those looks start to fade ( and they will ) . So IMHO this was a great talk.,1
7883,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Congratulations, you are a sexual commodity and have been brainwashed into thinking it a privilege....",1
7884,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just imagine the pain of being beautiful AND rich. Thank God I&#39;ll never have tocope with THAT agony. ; ),1
7885,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lex Luthor: Some people can read War and Peace and come away thinking its a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe.,1
7886,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There was no conclusion to this TED talk. Looks aren&#39;t everything because she is beautiful and still insecure? Good argument. I really hate to be the one to say it, but it wasn&#39;t a strong argument...I was hoping for more. It felt so incomplete.",1
7887,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is self indulgent. This speech is common sense and therefore unnecessary.,1
7888,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,My first ted talk ever...love it,1
7889,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are everything for women. It&#39;s all they&#39;ve got.<br>Men have looks, money and social status.<br>I&#39;m sorry whamen.",1
7890,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this talk is amazing  why have i never seen this? i just had to google her,1
7891,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She so cute! Thumbs up!,1
7892,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,At least she gets genetic lottery nonetheless,1
7893,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I smelled her insecurity in the first 30 seconds of the video.,1
7894,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,To all the salty people whining about the title in the comments: she&#39;s not saying looks aren&#39;t influential in society - quite the opposite in fact. She&#39;s trying to say they <b>shouldn&#39;t</b> be influential.,1
7895,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she thinks that she is considered beautiful because there are certain beauty standards that were created in the last 2 centuries and did not exist before, which isn&#39;t true. does she also think that her beeing white is the only thing that makes her beautiful? because it almost sounds as if she is demonizing her skin color. she completely forgets many other traits of her body some are beautiful but also others who are not beautiful at all. i bet her boyfriend is black cause that would fit to what she was saying here.<br>she made kind of a shortsighted impression and her way of think is too superficial imo. that wasn&#39;t a good ted talk.",1
7896,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yea ok I don&#39;t see hot bitches working to hard,1
7897,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beautiful inside and out.<br>For those who will criticise her, criticise all you want but know two things: First,coming on Ted and  practically saying the whole modeling industry-her industry- is built on lies may cost her the rest of her career and probably leave her unemployed because it will be difficult to restart from there. Second, if any of you hypocrites were in her place, you would never have the courage to do what she&#39;s done, to revel in the adoring crowds that come with that job. And lastly, she didn&#39;t come on Ted to talk to overweight 35 y.olds that complain about her being part of &quot;the system&quot; because you could easily shed the weight off if you had the resolve, she&#39;s not talking to people who consider themselves less attractive because you seriously need some self-confidence, everyone is beautiful if they find their own style, do you think she&#39;s always been that pretty? She WORKED for it, she&#39;s not talking to asians or blacks or latinos because you guys are gorgeous, maybe not by today&#39;s standards but who cares about today&#39;s standards? (I&#39;m north african too, tunisian).  She&#39;s talking to teens that, instead of wanting to become doctors and engineers, want to become models. She wants them to know what they&#39;re getting into before getting involved and, later, shocked like she was. She&#39;s trying to warn them, it may not be clear either because of the subtlety of her words-she can&#39;t freely criticise her bosses- or because some of you just hear what you want to hear and filter the rest out, but it&#39;s there.",1
7898,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Well this is some bullshit looks matter it&#39;s like bill gates saying money doesn&#39;t matter believe me I&#39;m a billionaire lol,1
7899,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What did she just say? I was far too distracted by her beauty to hear her.,1
7900,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Absolutely amazing Ted talk  This was great message at the right time ,1
7901,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I get her message, and she was very brave to open about her insecurities and to give us a valuable lesson. But I think she could have just given the talk a different title.",1
7902,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a beautiful idiot...,1
7903,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Having looks doesn&#39;t grant you happiness.<br><br>Not having looks forbids you from ever having happiness.,1
7904,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m beautiful and my life is so easy because I&#39;m pretty. I get free stuff and cops let me go easy. I&#39;m still not happy. Skinny thighs shiny hair boo hoo. It&#39;s not enough. Ooooook what&#39;s your point? This was utterly pointless. Also, very awkward delivery and no connection with the audience.",1
7905,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Money is not important, believe me! I am a scientist!  Bill Gates",1
7906,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"At it&#39;s roots, models are supposed to be skinny, so that the &quot;coat hangers&quot; won&#39;t distract from the product.  It isn&#39;t comparable to walking into a room full of strangers, and realizing you don&#39;t have to wear cool clothes, nor speak intelligently...to have the attention of the room. To learn from childhood that you don&#39;t need to work hard or smart or even be nice to people, in order to have something pleasurable they want from you. The title of this speech is misleading, because in everyday life, looks are like having wealth. They give you more options in life. But while you can work hard to have wealth, either you have genetically good looks or you do not. At our core, our purpose in life is to procreate, and that&#39;s why looks are &quot;Everything&quot;, because we are geared biologically to react to good looks.<br> <br>The only people who honestly believe looks aren&#39;t &quot;everything&quot;, are those blessed with them. Same with wealth. The poor man knows EXACTLY what wealth is worth. The average-looking person knows how much, and how often, they get ignored. Of course, there are some people in the middle--the person earning $100,000 a year may not feel rich, since they live in a wealthy neighborhood, probably share friends from the same university and social-economic status that got them there, drive a Corvette but not a Ferrari,  and their boss makes more than they do. But put that same earner in a poor neighborhood...and suddenly they realize how wealthy they are.  What are problems for other people, are inconveniences for them because they can actually afford the solution. <br><br>The same is for anyone with above-average looks, or on a scale of 1-10, the person who is a 7 (that&#39;s to say, they attract only 70%). They can&#39;t get a 9, so they feel as though their looks aren&#39;t everything. But they don&#39;t have the right perspective.  They&#39;ve grown up looking that good, they got their looks from their parents who have lived with the benefits, and they are surrounding by equally good looking friends (and if of the opposite gender, its likely to get a date from them) who go thru life with the same benefits and attitudes.",1
7907,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks fade away with age especially in white people. So you people shouldnt worry about your looks but rather admire that your wrinkles wont be exposed by the media ,1
7908,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but we are all insecure. To say a modeling job doesn&#39;t diminish insecurity isnt reflective of anything- especially considering that your body and face is the commodity in modeling.  I don&#39;t think she is successful is showing how looks are not everything and that being a working model is not a great job. If anything she reinforced the point that looks are very important. Lastly anyone can do an outfit change and affect what people think of you. I can put on a fucking clown wig and you&#39;d think I&#39;m insane lol. I love how she equates privilege to her 6 second out fit change.,1
7909,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"worst ted talk I have ever seen, nothing like a model telling you looks aren&#39;t everything, when her whole life is predicated on it...if looks didn&#39;t matter we would never know who she is...",1
7910,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are initially important because by human nature we go by looks initially. Then we look for other aspects within that person that we also like. Hence the term &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&quot;.,1
7911,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for sharing your life story.,1
7912,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good that she came to the surfice, to make her point.<br>I am from Brazil and by that men, shoot towards me:<br>Oh I  heard that women from Brazil got big butts and huge boobs, nice bodies, you must be sexy.<br>In a chat room without any image, that sound so gross, stereotyped concepts. <br>Giselle Bndchen os from the south of Brazil, and she had her nose tweaked, boobs and after all those years two kids no genetics can bless her that much, to not age, get wrinkles, they pay the best of the best surgeons to pimp their looks.<br>Naomi Campbell, is nearly bald, she wear wigs all the time, she has an explosive personality, so my point is no one is so blessed, to be perfect, young, beautiful through the years.<br><br>We are not just a piece of meat.<br>Glad to come across this video.<br>Is so good to feel comfortable in your own skin. Health matters, everything else is just superficial.",1
7913,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks may not be important but she is beautiful and seems to have a wonderful heart, and that makes me truly want to bone her. Is that wrong?",1
7914,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I can&#39;t comprehend how she had to cover up etc because of jealousy from other girls. Just so alien and sad to me as a male.,1
7915,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything I believe, brains and feel for things is after this talk I feel",1
7916,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow...you suffer so much huh?,1
7917,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I thought she was going to make a good point, but she managed to say nothing relevant. Feel like she could have done a lot more with this presentation",1
7918,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just imagine being that gorgeous. Just saying. Lol,1
7919,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great talk and powerful imagery for our teenagers and tweenies.  Big applause Cameron. So thrilled for you, in taking a brave step and using your voice - (wow and on TED), on personal imagery, advertising and modelling industry.    Your talk will definitely help/educate young wanna-be models, understand little more truth to what is occurring on in these industries &amp; hopefully to take more pride in their appearance.  ps: Nerves are a good thing... imho it means you really care about the talk you are about to give.",1
7920,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I applaud her for using her position to highlight the truth. And I respect her for seeing the struggles of others. She may be insecure, but she&#39;s not shallow.",1

7922,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,White guilt and identity politics at its finest. Youre sexy... get over it.,1
7923,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I did not get the message &quot;looks aren&#39;t important&quot; from this talk.  What I heard is that our culture and society makes looks TOO important.  Beauty isn&#39;t something earned.  Accomplishments, like a ninja neonatal thoracic surgeon poet, are more worthy of praise, because that is something you earned.  That is the message I heard.",1

7925,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hello Cameron:  although you are also beautiful on the inside, and of course on the outside,  you will be empty.  That emptiness can only be filled with the Joy of the the Lord Jesus.

7928,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Agreed looks is winning genetics well said, but dont judge ppl for wanting to persue beauty bcos they r not born priviliged constructions or not. U can b beautiful without being a model if the choose just to b a civilian. And wat does the color of ur skin has to do anything with beauty all color can b beautiful,hence ur not insecure in how beautiful u r, ur just insecure in competing with ur other gene lottery winners of ur kind of beauty...to real undisabled mortals u r worlds away from there reach and this has nothing to do with a model career persute ..u speak some truths but beauty and world problem are worlds apart.Sexual market value is everything so looks is everything,couples and married couples get married bcos of initiall attraction aka <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23looks"">#looks</a> is beauty is also subjective hence odd and interacial couples. Go privilige girl but is she also have a creative mind not just amazonion looks cashing out on ur looks in work and relationships.",1
7929,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I was once a 10 now im probably a 7 now and I finally learned that no matter what i looked like people are still going to find a flaw and that&#39;s very interesting like your life so unimportant that you&#39;d honestly waist time worrying about me and my problems..theres people who dont care about how u feel only that they know ur ugly.i wonder if im ever going to meet another soul like me.i just. Get this 1 life and ive had so many bash and laugh but im honestly happy to be alive,1
7930,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,the first minute had me so confused. i did not pay attention to what she was wearing.,1
7931,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t feel guilty or apologetic for who God created me to be nor should anyone. Oprah grew up poor. So did I. She became a billionaire. I didn&#39;t. She doesn&#39;t owe me an apology.,1
7932,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,look at these comments lmao,1
7933,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I find her humble honesty to be her true beauty. She is speaking truth from her heart and from fact. I was a beautiful young woman [now 51] and I can tell you that it got me out of tickets and it got me backstage at concerts and everyone wanted to be &quot;my friend&quot;. I&#39;ve learned what the true meaning of a friend is and those people are still with me and I can count them on one hand, and those are the only kind of people I want to surround myself with. The tickets started getting written as I got older and I&#39;m not dog meat by any means, but it just shows how shallow beauty is and it really is a superficial thing, especially if you&#39;re not pretty on the inside. I feel much more confident now than I ever did when I was young and &quot;beautiful&quot; because I am beautiful on the inside. I have gratitude for the blessings I have in my life! I love who I am and if someone wants to turn what I&#39;ve just said into something ugly, so be it. I know the truth. My animals know the truth because they don&#39;t care what I look like when I feed them each morning. I hope that each and every person in this world can find true happiness from within and have confidence in that.",1

7939,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I could not believe that her speech would be a TED Talk. It&#39;s Ok that she wanted to personally share some stuff but I really found parts of it offensive. The one part I liked is the comparison pictures--her with her grandma on the beach v the photo of her in the swimsuit. However, there was nothing about what she or other women can do to try to help reverse the sometimes deadly  impact on girls when inundated with generally unattainable images of women.",1
7940,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you say you want to be a model, what you are really saying is I want to be a canvas for other people to live their creativity on my body and be admired for the result that their work leaves on me.<br>Wouldn&#39;t it sound more appealing to be the one living freely and expressing their creativity?<br>This is a very important talk, but only those who care will ever see it, because the others are blinded by the sparkles added in post. We don&#39;t see what is and we don&#39;t believe what is true, we see and believe what we want to unless we take a good hard look at ourselves and notice that about us.

7951,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I was born ugly and was an awkward looking tomboy for years, and people were rude to me. Then I hit puberty and discovered makeup, and people were downright nasty and out to get me. This may seem like a paranoid statement, but many things happened to me based on how I looked, not how I treated people (which was always kindly, although I learned it means many people will walk all over you and take advantage of you). People who figured out how to be attractive shouldn&#39;t be punished for it, and I do agree they shouldn&#39;t be rewarded for it either. Getting out of a speeding ticket doesn&#39;t outweigh getting punched, bullied, condescended to, or having people assume you&#39;re an idiot because you seem like you care how you look. Everyone should treat each other better, period.",1
7952,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I wonder if this is where all this garbage stated.  Yes, she has a point about how looks are not everything and every person out there is insecure.  But lets stop with the &quot;Im going to apologize for what is biologically attractive, and I am going to apologize for being white.  By the way, I once got something for free and got a warning as a teen for speeding so this must be because I am a white attractive girl.&quot;  And &quot;oh, by the way let me show you some inaccurate figures about how police are all racists to top it off.&quot;",1

7956,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,We have to learn from Americans about what kind of person We are. I better kill myself!,1
7957,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That was amazing to hear. But bear in mind the problem originated in that part of humanity that is obsessed with what we call beauty and through generations and generations men seek beautiful women as wives and they produce children who are prettier and prettier by the minute .and vice versa with boys. If course we all know that beauty resides inside. By evolutionary aspect, this epidemic of the average man or woman believing or seeking there is such thing as perfect beauty has spiralled out of control. Now that these very beautiful humans can be seen at the cornershop at the bustop, like copies , we need to question what is going on in the human psyche to create this, is it lust? What is it someone please tell me. And if the world is swarmed with these genetically selected &quot; beautiful&quot; people ( not saying I am not pretty myself, I can show u a picture of myself , depends on who is looking at me lol), there are bound to be girls and boys who really will be affected in some ways no matter how positive they try to be. You hear them saying  hey man, why is it getting more and more difficult to feel a real sense of self worth. Of course many people can shake this self doubt off and be content and be grateful for how they are created, it is a destructive force inherent in this modern society where people can mate with more than one beautiful women or men  because that&#39;s all they seek and make upgraded offsprings,  then you ask yourself why some young girls decide to harm themselves cause they are viewd as &#39;plain&#39;. It is a very difficult matter to solve. May God have mercy on us all. Like it was said&quot; lust is insatiable&quot; and it is absolutely correct. God bless.",1
7958,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Shes speaking honestly about her point of view. I love when anyone does this. All the haters here are speaking about their point of view too. <br><br>Everyone can find beauty and failures in their own experience.,1
7959,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
7960,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beauty is both a gift and a curse!!! Youll get your way but sometimes it also gets in ur way i think...,1
7961,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Okay this is cliche but I believe it. Everyone is beautiful in their own way. Diversity is nice. But I feel like magazines define like one ideal as beautiful. I feel like models are either very slender or heavy set but there isn&#39;t much variety. Oh well...I don&#39;t buy magazines because I feel like it&#39;s paying for ads or to be told what looks good. Ya know magazines tell us what&#39;s not good enough and then we buy crap to fix what wasn&#39;t broken...Lol it&#39;s a vicious cycle that I&#39;m not participating in. I&#39;m sure some magazines are great but ya it&#39;s just one more reason to justify being cheap.. I&#39;ll admit. I love my lotions and potions and I spend some time and money on that, but ya for the most part I feel like if it&#39;s not broke, why fix it...I mean why add stuff to worry about. Like so what if I&#39;ll never have skinny thighs because of genetics...there is a lot to be said about being happy with what you&#39;re given.",1

I have to try 10 times stronger to get same job, same friends etc. than some modelish man. Not even thinking about girlfriend. But it is life which is really cruel to those not born quite beautiful.

8007,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I find her &quot;talk&quot; a bit disingenuous. Maybe she means well, but there&#39;s a lot of misguided facts in what she says. First, I have personally witnessed a traffic cop let a black dude go after he was pulled over. The man was polite and respectful to the officer and the officer was a cool guy. Sometimes it happens - sometimes it doesn&#39;t. Beautiful white women get traffic tickets all the time. As for the young black youth in NYC getting stopped and frisked - perhaps it&#39;s because a 30-something year old fashion model isn&#39;t likely to be committing armed robberies or street crimes. She acts holier than thou, but I bet she holds her bag a little tighter when (if) she walks through a black neighborhood.  Also - her looks make her acceptable for the fashion business, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s everyone&#39;s ideal beauty standard in real life. To each his/her own, but most people find models too thin and quite plain. Just saying.",1

8013,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Personally, I thought she explained herself very well. The comment below nailed it",1
8014,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Nice message. But I wouldn&#39;t say that she looks good or pretty in an attractive way. Model style yes, but not attractive. What she won is the lottery to match the average people&#39;s taste that give her fame, the rest follows from that.<br>It&#39;s annoying she thinks she is objectively pretty, she is not!<br><br>What people consider pretty are just certain metrics, and shapes, but real (visual) beauty looks different, and usually is more individual and special, though people would still appreciate it even if not all share the same taste.<br><br>She is beautiful in an average way (and according to current trends) with some odd features, which is why many agree, but she is most definitely not attractive in general.<br><br>The annoyance comes from the fact that some metrics shared by average people are made to be some universal truth it is not. Really beautiful people shine from the inside (and yes, that also affects looks) and you rarely envy them, at least not in a negative way.<br><br>Many people have a skewed view of beauty, that resembles product evaluation, which is what models really are -- products that should match fashion perfectly -- and not true beauty or prettiness.<br><br>That&#39;s also why many get confused. The most hate comes not from the advantages so called beautiful people get, it&#39;s from the standardized judgements of what is supposed to be universally attractive, when it really is just an average taste.",1
8015,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is trying to explain to young girls what a fake industry modeling is and how they are nothing more than a product. I give her a lot of credit for exposing this fake industry with such class. How many young girls see &#39;only the glamour side&#39; when fake pictures are shoved down their throats everywhere they look. It&#39;s a fake institution to sell a product at the expense of our young girls well being. I refuse to buy any products that objectifies women, its the only way to stop victimizing our young children. If everyone would stop buying into this propaganda maybe our young girls would stop believing they have to look like this to be important and our young males would stop waiting for that perfect fake model who is never going to show up.",1

8019,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Is not even about having a beautiful face. I&#39;m a 28 years old average man.

8045,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are a beautiful soul Cameron.!!!!!,1
8046,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She said literally nothing. What was the point of this talk?,1
8047,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You do have a beautiful mind and heart.  Very mature for your age to realize that looks aren&#39;t everything.,1

8059,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yeah, right..",1
8060,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"hmm I don&#39;t think she&#39;s saying &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot;. I think she&#39;s saying that being good looking or &quot;beautiful&quot; (because after all those are very socially constructed ideals) can get you material gains, but they can also get you a lot of insecurity. especially for women, whose social value is largely defined by how we look vs. what we can achieve or accomplish. <br><br>what I don&#39;t get is that she talks about young girls feeling bad and insecure about themselves, but won&#39;t acknowledge her role in making them feel that way. she makes it seem like the fashion industry is some amorphous entity above her over which she has absolutely no control, yet she&#39;s still complicit in how it determines beauty. profiting off the insecurities of others and then speaking against those insecurities = nagl.",1
8061,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what is the point of this speech? she just made jokes and apologized for being white and pretty.,1
8062,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I won the other genetic lottery: Intelligence/cunning/assertiveness. And I am not apologizing for it.,1
8063,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"it wasn&#39;t exactly what I was expecting, but it&#39;s still a good, inspiring video",1
8064,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s surprising how much it takes for us to identify or realise something.<br>Beauty is defined by how you look.<br>Wealth is defined by how much money you have.<br>Intelligence is defined by how much you score in a test.<br>How many friends or followers you have determines your coolness.<br>What you show on your social networks shows what your life is, and so on and so forth.<br><br>All of these social constructs we&#39;ve made or we do without knowing until something happens. Until that rich person coommits suicide. Until that intelligent person realises they don&#39;t know everything. Until that beautiful person starts going through depression. Until that popular person realises they only have followers for how cool they are, and not who they are.<br><br>It&#39;s true what she&#39;s said - looks really aren&#39;t everything.<br>What we have isn&#39;t everything. The latest tech, the expensive car or house or boat, the amount of followers, the money.. All things exterior, all things materialistic. We have people in this world who have it all and still aren&#39;t happy, still feel sad or depressed or suicidal, or struggle with life. We&#39;re all vulnerable.<br>See the inner beauty in life itself. There&#39;s fulfilment in the way we treat others. There&#39;s satisfaction with doing something we actually love, and not just for things materialistic. We realise happiness is not in your pocket or your wallet, it&#39;s not in that nice car or nice house, it&#39;s not residing in how you look, it&#39;s not in your follower count or your social status, it&#39;s not in the alcohol, it&#39;s not in the drugs, it&#39;s not in your next pay day, it&#39;s not in the lust, it&#39;s not in terror, it&#39;s not in binge eating, it&#39;s not in movies, or what he said or she said, it&#39;s in your heart. It starts within us. How we value ourselves and others starts with yourself.<br><br>Watch the world around you. Not what&#39;s always on your phone. Don&#39;t keep worrying about your past, or stressing about your future. Enjoy the moment! The now. Don&#39;t count the days by how much has gone by, count the days by how much you live. Because what you do matters, you matter. Love you ",1
8065,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"As a hetero man I don&#39;t find many of her photos attractive at all.  Because I know they&#39;re manipulated as she said, just like an advertisement.  And I despise advertising.",1
8066,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Awesome presentation. Loved it,1
8067,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What&#39;s the value of the speech? We already know about people born privileged and people who are not. So is it the part of &quot;but feel pitty coz we have to strive to look good so much&quot;? Or the part of &quot;here&#39;s something I do/want to propose regarding the inequalities&quot;? Sorry, my bad, she never made this part XD",1
8068,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t understand how the title relates to the Tedtalk,1

8071,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A lot of people in the comments are missing the point of this Ted Talk. To the media and society, looks are everything. When it comes to who we are as people, they are not. I don&#39;t understand why people think that people, especially models, who are thin and beautiful and profit off of their beauty aren&#39;t insecure. It&#39;s literally their job to keep up a certain image of themselves society wants us to see, and if they fumble a bit the cut-throat fashion industry will squash them like a bug. She was incredibly brave to come up her, not only for risk of losing her job maybe for going against the very industry she is employed with, but also because a lot of you do not understand that no matter how beautiful some may be, how happy they may seem in the magazines and commercials, everyone goes through their own struggles.",1
8072,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But she&#39;s an ugly model,1
8073,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Damn i feel so bad bcz watching her talking about the bad side of modeling makes me feel better abt myself and my body it&#39;s like enjoying someone&#39;s suffering which is really bad uk i feel sorry for her though and i&#39;m thankful to her and impressed how she was able to speak up abt it so bravely i really admire her now,1
8074,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,its still great to be good lookin&#39; ;),1
8075,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Please. She did not transform what we thought of her in six seconds. Gazillions of slightly less attractive but equally fit young women wear basically that same dress every day either for work or going out after work.  It doesn&#39;t possess a tenth of the power she assumes. Nevertheless, watching this video I sympathize with this woman, her beauty is a golden cage, as her intellect will never be taken seriously by men or women, at least not in brief encounters, and at the same time her pooh poohing her own beauty advantages only sounds insincere, and verges toward pretentiousness when making points about racial difference.",1
8076,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow plot twist at the end, that just goes to show you self image really does come from within",1
8077,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"rich people says , money isnt everything and dont matter<br>handsome people says , look and beuty isnt every thing and dont matter<br>well i think it does",1
8078,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Self esteem is everything,1
8079,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you.,1
8080,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks can tell you a lot about a person. Genetic material is probably the most important.,1
8081,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If we are programmed to like white skin, why do you tan?",1
8082,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Every person is not satisfied by what they have and that&#39;s why nobody is happy,1
8083,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is like a rich person telling me it&#39;s not about the money,1
8084,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There&#39;s a problem with this talk, IMO - and a problem with the comment made by MissDistarr60 (with an incredible 4.2K &quot;likes&quot;). First, while the speaker is certainly qualified to say, &quot;Believe me, being a model ain&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked-up to be,&quot; she&#39;s not really qualified to say (or know) what it&#39;s like to look &quot;average.&quot; All she can do is <b>imagine,</b> and while it might be satisfying to hear a model reassure us that, &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything,&quot; we already know this, don&#39;t we? - and fact is, most &quot;average-looking&quot; folks would still like to be beautiful. And, if push-came-to-shove, I doubt the speaker would trade her assets in, either, however &quot;superficial&quot; they might be.<br><br>As for the comment - why the 4.2K &quot;likes&quot;? What has she said that&#39;s so profound? She reminds us (as though we didn&#39;t know) that magazine covers are photo-shopped, and to &quot;not judge a book by its cover,&quot; but more superficially, that it&#39;s better to be &quot;beautiful inside&quot; than to be lovely-looking and have a &quot;hateful and miserable soul.&quot; As though those are the only two options, when - news flash - they aren&#39;t. Plenty of &quot;beautiful&quot; people are also quite nice, while plenty of average-looking people possess dreadful personalities. So, you can actually BE beautiful AND be cardiothoracic surgeon / poet (I know, bc I went to med school with some of them!) just as you can be average-looking, or downright unattractive and a downright horrible person, to boot. I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s any correlation, much as we might like there to be - and I have to believe that a lot of folks <b>want</b> that correlation to exist - at least 4.2K of them do.<br><br>In the end, a model who slips on a wrap-skirt and flats doesn&#39;t fool anyone - and even an un-photoshopped pic of Cameron Russell is unlikely to be disappoint or shock. I don&#39;t doubt it when she says (essentially), &quot;Even I feel insecure&quot; - I just wonder if that makes anyone else feel &quot;more secure.&quot; Maybe? Probably not. Lots of great TED Talks out there, no question. I&#39;m just not sure this is one of them - at least it wasn&#39;t for me.",1
8085,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A model says, <i>&quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything&quot;</i> .  That&#39;s just as soothing as a multi-million lottery winner telling me <i>&quot;Money can&#39;t buy happiness&quot;</i>",1
8086,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why would she have to apologize for being white or pretty or skinny... She was born like that. Prefernces are natural this ain&#39;t racism. It&#39;s easy to blame society for your personal problems. She being insecure has nothing to do with her being a model. Everybody is different nobody is equal we have accept that fact.,1
8087,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why are everyone saying making fun of her saying that looks aren&#39;t everything? Like honestly she is a model meaning that she has experience with being perceived as beautiful in turn making her more informed on what looks gain you,1
8088,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Men are afraid of beautiful women,1
8089,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Truly exceptional talk! Wow,1
8090,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hah, beautiful people complaining about the problems of being beautiful.<br><br>Is just like rich people complaining about their money. Its just their attempt to get ahead on the oppression olimpics while keeping their advantages.",1
8091,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah right. She changed her clothes, and now she believes that she&#39;s less attractive?",1
8092,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love this. She acknowledges her beauty and that it makes her privileged. Shes so educated and truly beautiful on the inside and the outside.,1
8093,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I knew from the title that she was a model...When she came up on stage, my first thought was that I personally did NOT find her really pretty.  But she became beautiful in my eyes as she started talking...she understands, she gets it and she&#39;s honest about it in a way that is humbling and caring.",1
8094,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Life isn&#39;t everything! Believe me, i am alive!",1
8095,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She sounds nervous,1

8101,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,blah blah blah......pffffft,1
8102,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Self love is beauty.,1
8103,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"With so many negative comments, it&#39;s no wonder she feels insecure. I think many of you were quick to judge without trying to be open minded and listen!",1
8104,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She even went ivy league high school. She definitely won lottery of genetics, height, and intelligence....",1
8105,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The beauty of this speech is that everyone has a different opinion about the message its sending. There is no right answer to what it is.,1
8106,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Take a deep breath. <br>You&#39;re much prettier and sexier when you shut up.,1
8107,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I understand people that says that because she is beautiful she said that,but, what if someone is really gorgeous but doesn&#39;t have personality at all, how can that person be beautiful? It gets boring and another thing is that when you are that beautiful you are not able to be remembered as the smart girl or the funny girl you just the pretty girl. I don&#39;t know but I get it in that way",1
8108,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The title is  misconceiving,1
8109,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why is she so out of breath?,1
8110,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,foolish the truth is looks are everything  trying to cover the truth with sweet lie is no sense but this vedio actually speak how important looks are....all the ugly ones are happy because they don&#39;t know what this vedio actually is,1
8111,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The point being made is that you often think, life would be easier if I was a bit more pretty, but the truth is that if you have a more attractive face you are no different from the way you are before, your looks will last you no more than a few decades, and once they fade, life will be much harder than when you looked good. People say that only models would speak negatively about beauty without understanding why they say it, holding the thought of well I bet my life would still be better if I was more beautiful, ignoring the message that they are sending, that having a beautiful face would likely make your more insecure about your image than not, make you strive harder to keep relationships with your personality and not your body, and work more diligently to prove that you are in fact- not all looks. <br>Empathize before you criticize.",1
8112,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Your beautiful and such a nice lady to and  very  nice speech to,1
8113,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow some of you guys are really so stupid, who would bother to watch a talk about some average human talking how unimportant or important looks are? it wouldnt be interesting and everyone would be like &quot;hah sure ok&quot; <br>her point was that looks shouldnt SUPPOSED to be everything, yet it means so much in our world <br>can you guys not view this talk in a different perspective other than your biased one? <br>i think she has more right to talk about the privileged life of a model than any of you guys do and its the fact that her looks gave her so many &quot;get-away&quot; points that she decided to make a ted talk about it, because it shouldnt be happening and yet it does",1
8114,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=1m20s"">1:20</a> I had to close, it is sooo boring",1
8115,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Easy for you to say,1
8116,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel sorry for all the people in the comments section who feel so insecure about their looks. May you get the strength to fight your fears.,1
8117,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I clicked yourube... stop fucking reccomending this to me now,1
8118,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"OMG, she didn&#39;t have a period when 16 years old?",1
8119,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"We can do a lot! to transform how we look. Exercise, eat well, sleep well, stop all drugs, get a healthy tan. Ugly people can literally become gorgeous. What is she talking about? Height cannot change... but thats about it. When people lose weight the first thing that changes is the face.",1
8120,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What is the name of that wrap skirt thing,1
8121,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nice,1
8122,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What I have learned from life, completely healthy people who enjoy good health are quick to say to an unhealthy person &quot;at least it&#39;s not cancer&quot;, so if you don&#39;t have cancer every other health issue doesn&#39;t matter.  People sprawled out on their yachts in the Mediterranean looking relaxed sipping on a cocktail will tell you money doesn&#39;t matter and my all time favorite is the beautiful tall leggy woman telling another women who inherited her genes from a gnome that looks don&#39;t matter.  For many people, men and women, in many different ways looks do matter. There was a documentary about this, a kind of experiment, they employed male and female models and put them in different situations.  One was a woman who had no experience with a particular job opening and a woman with all the experience.  The pretty leggy woman was offered the job even though she said she didn&#39;t have experience, and the job requirements were adamant about experience.  All the other experiments favored the beautiful people.",1
8123,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is trying to say that most girls want what she had but the truth is even with all of that, those thing doesnt bring real happiness in her life. They are all superficial, yet have really powerful impact on other people. Ppl want it bcs those  things are fancy but to be honest, happiness cant be bought by materials bcs it&#39;s a feeling that we feel. How people value you is of more importance bcs that shows ur true worth. Been given all of those fancy things tht ppl go crazy for, she seeks to be valued more than just her looks. Get it people?",1
8124,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what an ignorant comment section<br><b>remembers the society</b><br>well it is &#39;normal&#39;,1
8125,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,An entire video about recognising white and pretty privilege and most of the comments are criticising the speaker for her privilege. That says more about the commenters than the speaker.,1
8126,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,<b>test</b>,1
8127,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Mind-blowing fact: The title is ironic and meant to attract people who like to form an opinion without having watched the video. You need proof? <br>Read the comments...,1
8128,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ahhh...The poor thing..,1
8129,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To all the retards that keep parroting the cliche &quot;Looks ain&#39;t everything&quot; I say BULLSHIT! I know what it&#39;s like to be fat, bald and cross eyed with coke bottle glass and I know what it was like when I finally was able to fix them issues and the stark difference in treatment from others that I experienced. No it wasn&#39;t just in my head, it was real. It was serene not having to approach women because for the limited amount of time I has fixed my looks, they approached me",1
8130,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She did a great job speaking. My favorite Ted Talk,1
8131,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is out of breath because she is nervous from all the bad tension. You can tell she is relatable and has struggles but society is so superficial, unrelatable and mean spirited. The job is extremely hard. There is psychology, geology, genealogy, and math attached to the job but y&#39;all don&#39;t see that do you??? Believe it or not 85% of models are very smart. Always remember models are human to and most human know how important it is to be socially polite (psychology), know where their traveling (geology), know their ethnic background (genealogy), and know how to count their own money (math). Know models don&#39;t know what doctors but doctors don&#39;t know what models know.",1

8144,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thats fake! How can they be insecure, having physical proof of they being pretty, i dont buy that, if there is a group of people that has real proof of &quot;being pretty&quot; its models, i dont buy that you are insecure, you look over the shoulder everybody when it comes to physical appearance, 0.001% of men are pretty enough for you to be partners, so yeah, thats not insecurity",1

8153,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beauty isn&#39;t everything.. but it is important... being an ugly man like me... means women are not attracted to me.. that they don&#39;t want me... that no matter what.. unless I was RICH... I will probably stay alone the rest of my life.  I&#39;m 56.. so my life is almost over.. but much of my life has been alone because women don&#39;t want me.   Being good looking isn&#39;t everything.. but being ugly and unwanted is devastating.  I haven&#39;t touched a woman in 7 yrs.,1
8154,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are everything, believe me, i&#39;m ugly",1
8155,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;And they are probably the most physically insecure women on the planet.&quot; OH FUCKING REALLY LOOOOOOL wtf,1
8156,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I want there to one day be a way people can experience other lives and conditions. I&#39;d ask this girl to walk around 300lbs heavier than she is now or have severe scarring and see what she learns from that.,1
8157,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I thought I was going to watch something I already knew, because I know that looks aren&#39;t everything. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ugly, I don&#39;t think that I&#39;m cute. I don&#39;t care what I look like, because I know it doesn&#39;t mean anything to who I am inside. There was so much truth in what she said. I was shocked to hear her say some of the things that came out of her mouth, and that made it an amazing, empowering, and unforgettable speech. I enjoyed it a lot.",1

8171,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Young black males stopped and searched! I wonder why.??? Ironic that she then goes on to say that she researched her talk!!!!,1

8174,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything,&quot; said only the beautiful people.<br>Maybe coz it&#39;s true haha. And looks are also visible in builds, smiles, quirks, movement. Anyone can be beautiful so long as they are confident and try to live up to who they think they are ;)<br><br>Also, confidence is overrated haha.",1

I would rather she did the opposite! Come out covered up, say &quot;this is really how I&#39;m comfortable, but now I will get uncomfortable; since I&#39;m talking about modeling, I&#39;ll do the speech dressed the way the industry wants me to...&quot; SOmething like that. A model talking about modeling and putting on clothes after coming out in a short dress does not make sense to me... I lost interest in her speech, but still listened to the rest........",1
8183,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She was in VS show ? Wow !,1
8184,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is soooo true, this perfectly describes how I feel. It&#39;s not an achievement it&#39;s luck there are so many better things to aspire to be. Being pretty is nice but it&#39;s not important.",1

8186,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Your topic sentence is bullshit. OFC a model thinks that looks are not everything, cause you have it, so it is not the thing that holds you back most in life! Like a billionaire who thinks that money is not everything, cause they have it and another thing is what holds them back most in life. Your title should be, &quot;looks r important, but learn to love who you r&quot; or &quot;looks r not everything, ... is&quot;",1

8188,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, I got to say I impressed her eloquent flow of words, her discomfort of knowing the reality of the real world we live in just simply beautiful.",1
8189,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very nice young woman. Humble and intelligent. I actually admire her more for her good manners and humility than her looks.,1

8195,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"We will always be attracted to attractive looking people, unless our eyes are scooped out. Sight is our dominant sense and there are very few people out there who will willingly scoop their eyeballs out.

8196,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everyone&#39;s talking about her advantages of being pretty but no ones addressing her advantages of being white.,1

It doesn&#39;t count for as much after high school, but I can honestly say that I have enjoyed a lot of access to things that not everyone around me had. I am not particularly funny, smart, charming nor am I as athletic as my look would suggest. I got access based mostly on my looks. It has been a boon throughout my life. That said, I would not say I won any genetic lottery. I have always thought of exceptionally intelligent people as the ones being born with the biggest advantage in life.",1

8205,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The idea that she has as advantage is an illusion. The essential limitations of being human are still in place. She&#39;s right in a way; looks are terribly deceptive.

8217,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So when an ugly person says beauty isnt everything theyre lying because they secretly wanna be pretty but when a pretty person says beauty isnt everything you dont believe because they cant possibly know since they havent experienced the other side? Lmao cant win with the comment section,1
8218,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good for her for speaking out about this. There are so many youths who are vulnerable to the subliminal messages about &quot;beauty&quot;, and that needs to stop. No matter what you look like from birth or even after suffering a disfiguring injury, you are still beautiful no matter what anyone says. It&#39;s personality that matters, not putting a &quot;mask&quot;(makeup) on our bodies to hide our &quot;ugliness&quot;. Of course if you wear makeup because you want to, that&#39;s perfectly fine.",1

Our species is littered with a high percentage of individuals who depend entirely in primal instincts and admitting that is just depressing. <br>Cameron Russell displayed a very deep insight into a person&#39;s worth. She is honest, she has benefited from her unique position and she is humble to analyze this in a way few do. She never said looks didn&#39;t matter, in fact she said the opposite. She just added a grain of salt that most don&#39;t ever want to hear. That life is never about a single specific thing. And it is flawed way of thinking that if you had that one thing, you would make it finally in life forever. So cherish what you have. Life is never fair, we all dealt a different bag of circumstances when we are born. Improving anything you want is also great. Just don&#39;t be naive thinking that everything will be great when you achieve something. Happiness has way more to do with the journey than the destination.",1

8230,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,pretty women who claim to be insecure is tiresome,1
8231,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She seems really nice,1
8232,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Having talked to different  models about their jobs the one observation that I took away was that it was a tedious boring job with a lot of sitting around and long periods of boredom as well as a very high likelihood that you might end up with a drug or health problem brought about because you have been told that you are too fat, too pale or too nervous and you take drugs illegal or otherwise to help you with these issues. Some of the worst of these have to be cocaine, alcohol or slimming tablets where there is a high likelihood of becoming too dependent on them.<br>Even worse would be the effect on your sense of well being being told because you think that you are too ugly, too fat , too short or too tall. This is all such bollox because beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and what may be sexy/beautiful/pretty to one person will be so different to so many others. <br>Being confident and comfortable in yourself is all that matters and being a model has such a short lifespan because you are considered too old at 30 which s superficial tosh.<br>Most of the models I  ever met were pretty vague, vain and superficial, they thought that the world turned around them, especially the male models I knew.<br>I met all these models when I lived in Munich, southern Germany and the standard of beauty was very high in this country when compared with the US or the UK where many women  have either too much make-up, are too plain or just  pasty-faced and fat, and in the western world these conditions are only set to rise and rise.",1

Etc etc. But I feel disgusted by those people. I know I should be grateful but I have trust issues, I know that some of them were treating me like that only because of the way I look. The old me would never get treated this way. <br>And those boys, who wouldn&#39;t even spare me a glance back in school, they look stupid when they think they can have me now. <br>Ofc I am still insecure, the old is still is me mentally, What I am trying say is that the bitter truth - people with good looks always fucking unfairly have a leverage.",1

8245,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Human beings are addicted to beauty. They like beautiful things, and when you say to someone that s/he is beautiful you&#39;ll change her/his mood.

8254,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,WoW!  This is the first time I have ever heard a White woman be so honest about the modeling industry &amp; all the freebies she got just based on her looks. I know it took guts &amp; I admire her for that. Many young women need to hear this talk and stop trying to chase some fantasy.,1
8255,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are part of the recipe for success. The recipe includes IQ, education, drive, goals, skills, organization, common sense and artistic ability. That said someone who is beautiful will have more opportunities and also more threats.",1
8256,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I didnt get the point of this talk,1
8257,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is close to perfection a triple threat. She has the brains (great public speaker) the beauty (just look at her) now all she is missing is the black belt in self defense (maybe it&#39;s in the works). Good job girl.

8259,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Her breathless voice made me too anxious to listen,1
8260,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ok so after 10 years of working in modeling she&#39;s yesterday&#39;s product and now she&#39;s complaining about racial and gender abuse? Intelligence and good looks certainly do not correlate...,1
8261,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is a load of crap. Nothing inspiring about it,1
8262,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You guys in the comment section are basically why she made this talk. Just because you were treated poorly because of how you look, you also believe that people should be treated based on their appearance too? She was brave okay?

8265,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,True.. I dont like her anymore after that stupid speech,1
8266,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah. Once the dowdy sweater and peasant skirt, she turned herself into a total dog. LOL. I am shorter than her but I&#39;m not ugly by any means. I can tell that people who think I&#39;m pretty Do treat me better. It&#39;s not an accomplishment For a while I had severe post car accident medical lymphedema and 100&#39;s and 100&#39;s of lbs.came on me in a matter of months. I had never treated anyone badly for extra wt. but the way I was treated was quite an eye opener. I was treated like a monster and doors got slammed in my face. In time the swelling went away and I was back to my old normal self. The same men who&#39;d slammed doors in my face when I was big as a rose parade float tripped over themselves to hold the door for me. It&#39;s a bunch of hooey how ya get treated if your configuration is pleasing to other&#39;s eyes. I too have been let out of bad situations for being &quot;not ugly.&quot;",1
8267,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Uncomfortable  just to improving your english,1
8268,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,her 4% fig of African models is realistic and understandable reasons r obvious instance there look is not in demand if it was thy would b in demand..fact is about 4% of ppl find such race attractive..even blk men put blk women has a 2nd choice or no choice so 2 put a racial element in 2 the mix is plain wrong..truth ppl don&#39;t find African descent women attractive very few do,1
8269,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wish that changed anything...,1
8270,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This sucked. And proves models are dumb and racist.,1
8271,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Are you just learning this? I thought women understood this better than men.,1
8272,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I usually never comment on videos, but I feel I have a little insight. <br>First, I wish she had spoken a little longer and gone into depth.<br>Second, Like everything in life, your blessing can be a curse. <br>I have experience with being treated differently because people perceive you to be beautiful or attractive. I applaud this woman because a &quot;good looking&quot;, &quot;attractive&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot; person speaking about the cons of being attractive is basically taboo. &quot;How dare she complain or talk about the dark side of beauty!? What an ungrateful privileged woman!&quot; When really, there is a dark side to being beautiful. <br>Yes, it is nice to have a cop let you go or to have someone open a door for you or buy you a drink, or invite you to cool places, etc. With that privilege, you also get people who follow you and stare at you and make sexual comments towards you and try to touch you inappropriately. You get cops who let you go, but not without first being a pervert. You have no privacy because people constantly watch everything you do in public. People will buy you a drink and invite you places, not because you have an awesome personality, but because they want a beautiful person around to make them look cool or feel special. You are constantly assumed to be an airhead with no intelligence or wit or personality, and when you express those qualities people compliment you like you are a cat that knows how to pee on a toilet because apparently, it is so rare to be good looking AND have some wit about you. You never know who truly cares about you, or who just wants to exploit you and get into your pants (this is with all genders). When it comes to workplace atmosphere, people often envy you and sabotage you or once again, try to make sexual advances. When you are young you are being sexualized by adults and your body becomes something that feels it needs to be hidden even amongst family members, school teachers, bus drivers, construction workers... <br>So yes, being beautiful got you a fancy dress, compliments, an open door to anywhere you want to go, but it also came, detailed in the fine print, that you will never feel safe and loved for who you truly are because you are like an object to most people. You are something to have around because you shine. But as we know, beautiful things tarnish. <br>Think of Hedy Lamarr, a Beautiful, intelligent, driven and resilient woman who struggled all of her life to get her ideas and inventions taken seriously, but couldn&#39;t get past the image of being a beautiful woman to people. People can really be very shallow and no matter how intelligent a beautiful person is, often time people just want them to shut up and be their beautiful pet.<br>Being beautiful does not excuse someone from life&#39;s ups and downs and problems. being beautiful does not automatically mean you will have a beautiful life. Beautiful people are shamed, made fun of and experience life all the same as everyone else. we all have our unique challenges and it&#39;s time we stop pasting this illusionary and unrealistic image upon people we find attractive. It is not real, it is not healthy and it is damaging to not only &quot;Average looking&quot; people and &quot;Attractive looking&quot; people all the same. <br>At the end of the day we are all just trying to survive with the blessings and the curses we are born with. You cannot invalidate anothers experience simply because you have not experienced it or because it seems silly to you. I mean, really, how superficial and self-involved is it to think that someone good looking doesn&#39;t have difficulties in life?? That&#39;s the movies kids, and the movies, we know, are not real. <br>Sending love to anyone who reads this &lt;3 <br>Quote from my Doctor: &quot;You&#39;re too beautiful to be depressed!&quot; - I was 15 when she said this",1

8277,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"omg screw your oppressions. Who buys all the magazines, women. That whole industry works to feed women what they want to see, and buy. Who buys all the trashy magazines that gossip and take sneaky photos of celebrities, women.  Women have created that culture, not men or society in general.<br>  On diversity, go to Korea and 99% of the models are Korean, In China 99% are Chinese, in India 99% are Indian. There is much more diversity in the west than any &quot;minority&quot; country, and much more opportunities for everybody.<br> Im confused what the message is, on the one hand you say you&#39;re privileged and special, but you&#39;re also an insecure victim who is misjudged and exploited. I dont get it.",1
8278,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very mediocre ted talk. Comes off a little braggish and no significant point was made here.,1
8279,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m a pretty white girl too, with big green eyes and dark curly hair, and a decent body to boot. And you get benefits. People want to be your friend automatically, people treat you nice automatically, that first pass it a free pass. But the thing is... I&#39;m also a weird girl. I have mental health issues and disorders, I have strange interests and I don&#39;t always act &quot;right&quot;. So beyond that first pass, things are not free. Everyone wants to be my friend <b>until they meet me</b> . Everyone lets me off easy until they realize I have nothing beyond looks to offer that they want. And suddenly these &quot;nice people&quot; don&#39;t want to be involved with me any longer, don&#39;t want the mark of ever being involved, so they get mean fast. People give me the chance to be friends (which more than ugly people get I know), but after its all me. And it&#39;s one thing to know that if they would give you a chance they would like you. It&#39;s another to know that everything they don&#39;t like about you? Is you. <br><br>You learn pretty quick not to trust nice people as a pretty girl because you pay interest on that &quot;free pass.&quot; And I&#39;ve figured out some people don&#39;t care that I&#39;m a person, they just want my body to use as they like. And maybe I still have the privilege. I&#39;m not shot for the color of my skin, I&#39;m not judged guilty over anything innocent, I&#39;m not criminalized for existing. Maybe I have it better with my lottery winnings here, but keep in mind it&#39;s not as perfect or nice as it looks.",1
8280,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So true,1

8285,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s ugly to me. But hey...,1
8286,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Communal narcissist,1
8287,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,its funny how the majority of the people will see this video and they will still be bitter. becous a pretty lady is telling them what is happening and how the world of pretty people works. and the truth ia that yeah they get treadet difrently but not better becous there are strings attached. everything has a katch. and she made that very clear. olso everybodu just glosses over how she tottaly just owend her privlage and makes sure to let it be nown she doesnt deserve her privlage. she has a genualy nice massage with only good points and poeple seem to gloss over that fact bedous thay are bitter that it is a pretty woman telling them that,1
8288,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,it is annoying how 6 inch tall skinny cute girls who pose for victoria secret says look isnt everything IT IS EVERYTHING,1
8289,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"that&#39;s true, apart from looks you also need money; if you have both then stars are the limit.",1
8290,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People feel threatened by very attractive people, are jealous and also wish them bad things. If you are a bit chubby, people will look down on you but won&#39;t mind befriending you as they wouldn&#39;t consider you to be their rival.",1

8293,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this was video was just made by attractive people to make a ugly people feel better about themselves. This video is just a waste of time. being attractive will always be beneficial, no matter where you are what you do. Its a hard truth to accept but it is what it is.  and plus a woman such as hers telling people that beauty doesn&#39;t matter is like bill gates telling people money doesn&#39;t matter.... in the age of social media your beauty will be more valuable than ever...........NOBODY CARES ABOUT WHATS INSIDE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
8294,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I Dont know why she&#39;s on stage in TED talk,1
8295,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Whatever you want it or not .. your physique and the way you looks is the first thing that others see and judge you by,1
8296,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yes, most models are white - in the white world! If you go to Africa or Asia then most models are non-white. I often fail to understand the logic behind insisting to have everything dominated by non-whites in whites majority or even whites only countries. I see the term best describing it as &quot;Lib-tard&quot; (a form of liberal degradation of the mind to such a severe level that it becomes a retardation).",1
8297,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So much respect for this woman,1
8298,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks arent everything. - Well,  thats because you have them.",1
8299,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just reading some of the hate comments here is proof that most people judge on appearance - they didn&#39;t even bother watching the talk and thinking about what she&#39;s trying to say! Now THAT&#39;s superficial!,1
8300,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very honest and caught my attention! I learned something from this,1
8301,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In that example of her being pulled over and being released by cops, I don&#39;t see why that has to be attributed to her beauty. I&#39;ve been in the car with people getting pulled over, and there have been times that we were released even though we were speeding.",1
8302,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Everyone looks good when they smile! It&#39;s true. Just smile alot, no matter what you look like. so called &quot;good looking&quot; people don&#39;t look good if they are arrogant, and frown.",1
8303,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why is everyone bashing her for telling her story she has the looks and personality yall dont need to bash her,1
8304,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are malleable and significantly controllable particularly as children. Our faces are made up of bone and muscle. Orthotropic dentists train children how to posture their tongue properly to support the upper jaw which improves the look of the whole face. Look up case studies by Mike mew. Genetics certainly helped you but if you mouth breathed your whole life you would be as ugly as the rest of us.,1
8305,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything<br><br>Yea you say that cuz you&#39;re a model and models aren&#39;t attractive . No curves,1
8306,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is like saying in the world of basketball, people of all heights, body sizes, and skill levels should be allowed to play in the NBA, or that in the world of sales, people of all speaking abilities and persuasiveness should be hired as sales people, or that in the world of medicine, people with any college GPA should be allowed to study and graduate as a cardiac surgeon.<br><br>There is absolutely nothing wrong with being endowed with characteristics that make a person more attractive to the majority of people on the planet.<br><br>The &#39;&#39;hairstylists, make-up artists, photographers, all their assistants, pre-producers and post-producers&#39;&#39; are akin to the scouts, the managers, the coaches, the trainers, and all the assistants that make an NBA player, the interviewers, the management who selects, the sales trainers, the mentors, and the team leaders that make a sales person, and the college admission board, the tutors, the tutoring assistants, the interviewers, the medical boards, the hospitals, the physician and surgeon mentors that make a cardiac surgeon.<br><br>Most professionals are not self-produced.<br><br>We all have limitations in what we can do, and it is better we learn to face those limitations than to brand the system unfair or the world unjustifiably biased.",1

8308,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks doesn&#39;t matter? Honestly it does . It matters for society (idiots), but our looks should not matter to us. Never let our self confidence be lowered only because you think you are &#39;ugly&#39;, and people think and judge you are &#39;ugly&#39;. Just go get a Google search &#39;Rejanikanth&#39;. He don&#39;t have that sh*tty looks. Still he is one of the top south Indian leads. (Actor) there are many more rare exceptions who had won  the battle only &#39;cause they don&#39;t care what people comment. They were focusing on work, not simply on judgements. They rose to fame and show them what they can do. Now, those society even praise &#39;em. And that&#39;s what is called talent. Another example might be adele, danush  (male lead actor). Difference is that the list is very short. No matter, tryna get into the list? You can...!! :)<br><br>P.s : English is not my mother tongue. :P",1

8320,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,OH COME ONNN! Who said life was gonna be easy i you were better looking? It&#39;s worse to live life being ugly because it is the sum of the horrible life plus the ugly appearance PLUS less opportunities.,1
8321,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That&#39;s a pretty big philosophical breakthrough for a model.,1
8322,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bullshit.,1

8326,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Q: if/when this girl gets a boyfriend what will he look like? Looks count no matter what,1
8327,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thouh i am ugly i believe look is not everything when somebody is super attractive they only get judge by their look and they attract negative ppl ....my cousin is super attractive and thats why he always get cheated because girls only like him for looks but if someone is ugly then only person who genuinely like you actually date uou.....thats what i think ,1
8328,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I remember having dinner with someones family and they had 2 teenage daughters at the time and I wound up talking to them most of the dinner. They were just more fun to talk to. I remember the oldest was 19 and the youngest was 15. They asked if I was dating someone and I said yes. They wanted to see a picture and while I was trying to find one on my phone they started all talking about how much looks matters in dating and all that. They asked me what I thought and I said &#39;No, I dont think so. You get used to what a person looks like after awhile and its the intellect and personality that will keep you interested&#39; About that time I found my pictures of my gf at the time whos honestly a blond bombshell. We werent just dating. We were buddies, too. So the way I looked at her changed drastically from the night I met her and was just floored by her looks to that time when she had become my best friend. So I handed my phone to these teenage girls and they spent the rest of the dinner teasing me about how &#39;looks dont matter&#39; and called me a total hypocrite for saying that and dating a woman that hot.",1
8329,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was a funny comedy skit. Maybe you should sell it to SNL.,1

8343,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but then it&#39;s not always slender now. they make fun of slender women now. but they like  thicker women around hips. i feel like the audience should focus on women with marks too in any size with as many fat.,1

8345,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I appreciated for your boldness but this doesn&#39;t change people&#39;s perspectives just because you pointed it out. Like you see the problems like everyone else does but do not have a solution... not that you&#39;re expected to.  The mindset that people have upon beauty and race has deeper roots than the influence of the fashion industry. And people who have the advantage over this certain perspective(usually white) seem to be the most reasonable group to be subjected to the accusation of racism... It speaks so loud so we often ignore the fact that a good amount of us(non-white) have the same guilty desire to imitate what we&#39;re not made to be. And it doesn&#39;t always have to be racism. same thing goes with if you&#39;re not tall, basketball might not be a great choice of career for you unless you have much better hop and speed than those who are taller. I believe you but not because you&#39;re a model. It&#39;s because being physically attractive doesn&#39;t guarantee a happier life that&#39;s a common sense.",1

The moment we as individual accept this wrong thinking, we imediately becomes a part of this world, saying we should accept and embrace this absolutely wrong standards. You know what is everything in life? It&#39;s us, individuals, saying, &quot;Soul is everything in life, bc it reflects who we truly are&quot;, or &quot;Right values and outlook in life leads us to treat everyone with respect regardless of their physical attributes&quot;, and &quot;Personality, and kindness of heart, leads us to the right person, which is our true love.&quot; There&#39;s far more here than meets the eye.

To use &quot;aren&#39;t&quot; in the title indicates a lack of existence, in this case the significant role of a physically attractive appearance in gaining advantages in society. Ms. Russell clearly expresses the opposite, and while seemingly contradictory to the title, I agree with her that looks do not define everything about who a person is nor should it consume so much of our insecurities. Overall, wittily presented, Ms. Russell. I thoroughly enjoyed your presentation.",1

8369,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You claim looks arent everything but you are telling us about the privelleges you get for being beautiful <br>Lol try to sync with reality cause it sounds like looks are everything,1
8370,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Oh as im watching along this turns out to be just a white guilt trip<br>Effing sick and boring,1
8371,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Omg were supposed to believe youre outfit changed the way we see you? Stick to modelling dear,1
8372,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ive just watched a tedex video before this one about how beauty effects our brain , and bottom line is : looks are everything.",1
8373,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"First off , why should you cover only cause youre atractive!! <br>Why should you cover at all!?!?!?",1
8374,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i hate TEDx,1
8375,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow...so many of you dont understand past a surface level thought. Looks, money, intelligence and popularity are all only great to a certain point, and it doesnt matter how much of these things you have because underneath it lies you. You and all the demons that you face because it is your personal struggle. It must be horrible being a model, having to constantly portray confidence in yourself when a lot of models are deeply insecure. You spend your time lying to yourself and everyone else. Same thing with intelligence, you can feel really stupid a lot of the time because you feel all your thoughts constantly have to reach the standard of your last genius idea. You cant make mistakes or your entire image and the peoples confidence in you is shaken. Focus on bettering yourselves. Everything you all claim is so important fades.",1
8376,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow she has put to words all those things quite beautifully (no pun intended),1
8377,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If your hair is shinier and you are a little bit skinnier you will be so happy and fabulous well my hair is shiny and thick and Im skinny but I dont have cheek bones or good bone structure.,1
8378,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Another elite person who has to throw race in the first 5 minutes......... what does being white have to do with it......... some of the most attractive people in the world are NOT white!! Another liberal elite person taking something as mundane as modelling into a racial issue!! Typical graduate from Columbia University........ Another race apologist!! She wants you to feel guilty for something you had no control over. Also, Stop and Frisk led to less crime in NYC!! If people of color want to be a model, then be a model........ I doubt any self respecting agent or photographer turns away prospective models because of their skin color....... But, in the end, the essence of her message is correct......... her message is 100% true and accurate.......... modeling and Hollywood in general is not real........ it&#39;s not real life........it&#39;s all make believe and designed to sell movies and product!!",1
8379,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t even like super skinny thighs.. I love muscular legs on a woman!,1
8380,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks don&#39;t matter, when you&#39;re pretty. <br>Money isn&#39;t important, when you&#39;re rich. <br>Yeah, I get the picture.",1
8381,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I would like to hear these words from you when you are 50,1
8382,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bullshit !!<br>A model says that ?<br>So pity I feel indeed,1
8383,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks arent everything true but its the majority of success,1
8384,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why is she trying to down play the importence of looks?,1
8385,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,incoherent presentation. said that she isnt that beautiful in real life compared to the ads pics. then continue to say how privileged her life is with this perception in the society. and never about how beauty is not everything.,1
8386,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is so bad lol,1
8387,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Even when you&#39;re looking for a job there&#39;s always &quot;attractive appearance required&quot;. What did you expect?,1
8388,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Honest video. Really shows the contrast on definitions of beauty,1
8389,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,White guilt trip,1
8390,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The title mine as well be:  Explaining how hard it is to be rich - to poor people, by a rich guy.",1
8391,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A black or Latino woman is more likely to be assaulted sexually molested or robbed by a black or Latino man whats your point,1
8392,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Pretty WHITE woman... Yes, she had to bring race into it...",1
8393,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,For sure life is hard for all kinds,1
8394,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,bro she so weak she gets tired speaking lmao,1
8395,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This talk felt all over the place.,1
8396,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i m blind was she attractive?she sounded like a model.,1
8397,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Im good that I was born average, it helps you see what this world really is.",1
8398,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow great Talk. <b>applauds</b>,1
8399,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,siyah beyaz ayrmna girilmeden sadece konu zerine younlalsa daha iyi olabilirmi bence konu geileri yznden odaklanmakta zorlandm gerekten,1
8400,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=2m20s"">2:20</a> im done it&#39;s enought bye! Be well and good luck in your life.",1
8401,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If he his not your boy friend then i guess its just work right!,1
8402,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Right and i should believe that ? just because you say it!!,1
8403,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nope not at all you did not change my perpective of you.,1
8404,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,yeap on that you are right image is powerful but not in the way you think.,1
8405,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So you think that clothing is everything about woman!!,1
8406,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You are absolutely not narcissic, you have all the virtues a man can dream of!!",1
8407,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Oh so it&#39;s supposed to be an humoristic thing. Sry then! i tought you where serious. but i dont see the funny trhing in that sry!!,1
8408,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oh really, you shouldn&#39;t . Why? you are married, why does it matter!! I f you can get better you will!!",1
8409,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,We can exercise to change our bodies. We can improve ourselves.,1
8410,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I know she doesn&#39;t mean anything bad but the truth is that looks definitely are extremely important. That&#39;s the sad fact off life. While I&#39;m definitely not a supermodel, I know for a fact that I am treated better in certain situations simply because I am &quot;conventionally pretty.&quot;",1
8411,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very intelligent and articulate talk about race and perceived beauty.  Bold and courageous.,1
8412,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"through all cultures men prefer lighter skinned women, its not just the industry",1
8413,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I train myself not to see sexual beauty.  IT might sound ridiculous but our culture is constantly jabbing us in the face to judge things based on looks.  To attempt not to is met with laughter and ridicule.  &quot;Oh you must have hit every branch on the ugly tree.&quot;  Perhaps.  =)  But for me at least, I seem to find the women who are introspective and humble incredibly sexy.   You will be naturally attracted to healthy, creative women.  Sexual beauty is just a genetic advertisement---  Should you be watching advertisements or figuring this out on your own?  This love thing?  I mean, how can you just make love to someone simply from a visual perspective?  It reminds me of that scene in Demolition Man when Stallone&#39;s character rejects the virtual lovemaking they do in that dystopian future.  Yes, you may want to say to me right now, ,&quot; its just the attraction in the beginning, its just the spark to get the fire going right?!&quot;  Well that fire is raging out of control thanks to &#39;Kim Kardashianism&#39;!  Or whatever you want to call that deification of empty headed beautiful women that is pervasive in our culture.  Which is fostered by Capitalism; still the greatest pimp of women only second to men themselves.  <br><br>I feel it is a more truthful perspective.  She seems very anxious towards the end but I admire and agree with her message.  It&#39;s refreshing to see someone like this, speak like this.<br>Llistening to her words and seeing her struggle with the stage has made her quite human and nobly beautiful.",1
8414,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Most pretty women arent models but still benefit enormously from their looks. Studies show that pretty women are more picky with their partners because the market value for prettiness is high in the dating world. Sadly, dating is subject to superficial capitalistic forces.",1
8415,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this is what white guilt sounds like, boo hoo, If you can believe it: there are actually things in this world thats worse than how wonderful your life is, dear.",1
8416,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I still didn&#39;t get what she was trying to say :),1
8417,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This..... The point is less relevant to our self image, what is important is SELF AWARENESS. Be aware of who you are, who your actions affect, how much you give/take away from society and nature. It is only then you can grow as a person and be the best form of YOURSELF.",1
8418,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,bullshit,1
8419,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Its interesting how she said they sexualised her even before her period. So basically images of sexy women are actually young prepubescent girls. I also know that in magazines they merge bodies of young girls with older models.<br><br>Beauty needs to be redefined. Who says being tall, prepubescent, white, very slender is the ideal. As creative human beings we need to realise beautiful paintings are made with many imperfections (as you guys call them).",1
8420,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Human nature makes this TED Talk irrelevant. Human nature always wins almost all the time.,1
8421,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The thing is shes not that attractive,1
8422,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When a woman has beauty they should be confident?  I really cannot understand why a beautiful person would not be, surely everything would come easier to them (mainly from men).  Guess I will never know being an ugly one haha! Well at least I am a well grounded individual ;-)",1
8423,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What Cameron is trying to create a awareness of, is exactly whats  happening right here within this comment section. Shameful. There&#39;s a vibe that as people watch her, they see only what they can  see. And that is a pretty, nave, privileged model decked out in the favor of her looks. Society beholding hoi polloi instantly creates a vision of her. A vision that portrays all but what she is. She showed us a series of her model  pictures, compared to a real-life picture taken very recently before the photoshoot, and proceeds to ensure that the sexy, seducing, white girl working the sunglasses is not her. But merely a vision that so many professional hairstylists, photographers,  makeup artists worked to achieve. In person, Cameron comes off as being a very down to earth, intelligent, and kind woman. Not to mention her  bravery for speaking against such a massive industry that she partakes in. And those traits are beautiful within themselves. People are missing the fact that the person models are manipulated to achieve, are not the true person that they actually are. And therefore, no, looks are not everything. It is what lyes within.",1
8424,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wtf? How old was she in all those pictures????,1
8425,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"nope, shes still gorgeous.",1
8426,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One of my MOST FAVORITE talks everrrr! Definitely. :) Well done, Cameron. Beauty AND Brains!",1
8427,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lmao she brought race into it that&#39;s so not true,1
8428,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you have a beautiful soul,1
8429,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No one is saying it is everything,but it certainly is a big part of social interactions and how people treat you",1
8430,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Eh shes so average. Shouldve used a really beautiful woman. <br>Be the most beautiful version of yourself, as long as that beauty matches your interior.",1
8431,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s hot but i felt she tried too hard to make the audience laugh that it was really cringey. But she did have a good message.,1
8432,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just like money, looks arent everything but it helps a lot",1
8433,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sorry what did she say? I was lost inside those eyes, but whatever she said or whatever she was selling heres my CC, funny I dont even remember her name.",1
8434,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Easy for her to say shes hot asf,1
8435,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are everything, so stop pretending otherwise Cameron Russell.",1
8436,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"well looks are everything if you choose that particular career path. No one forced her to become a model she could&#39;ve walked away but it was convinient. seriously I don&#39;t get the message she&#39;s trying to say also she mentioned the racial thing twice like that didn&#39;t really go anywhere. I won&#39;t even touch how bad performer she was anxiety and forced humor wise, that wouldn&#39;t be fair, she&#39;s a model",1
8437,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Her talk isnt powerful anyway because she already has that beauty look so obviously beauty is not her concern:/ but I am happy for her thinking more than looking,Ok obviously she is having a good life with her look.",1
8438,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Being ashamed of being white and beautiful is the most sickening and disturbing thing Ive ever heard. We shouldnt feel sorry and apologize for being prettier and superior to other races. Its pathetic and sickening. Models like her disgust me. ,1
8439,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She says looks arent everything but she seems a little stuck up, shes smart and pretty of course, but you cant say looks arent everything, especially when youre STILL a model and making money for it.",1
8440,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Umm hi .....,1
8441,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I normally dont comment on videos but she basically conveys that looks actually are everything. I get that she&#39;s insecure and stuff but arent we all insecure. She talks about problems we all have however in addition to all the &quot;model problems&quot; we normal people got also the looks problem. For me what she talks about makes no sense. If anyone has a different opinion feel free to discuss.,1
8442,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks arent everything. I should know as I am wealthy and have this platform to espouse my views because of my looks,1
8443,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Smart,1
8444,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sure, good looks aren&#39;t everything, but they&#39;re a huge advantage. Life isn&#39;t fair, so let&#39;s not try to sugarcoat that.",1
8445,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I totally agree with the title of that video,1
8446,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is very brave and honest. She did a wonderful job.,1
8447,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s based off of white skin, but she got a tan. What",1
8448,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is soooo touching reaally,1
8449,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m a ninja cardio-thoracic suergon poet. It&#39;s not that great. Too much pressure.,1
8450,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why are people in the comments such assholes?,1
8451,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this breaks my heart.,1
8452,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks are everything for girls not for boys,1
8453,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I get what she means. I have a hourglass figure with the big butt and full boobs, and I sometimes get bad treatment from some women and better treatment from some men. So, I get it",1
8454,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This woman clearly lacks any modesty. You don&#39;t tell an audience that you&#39;ve &quot;won the genetic lottery&quot; and expect them to be accepting of your speech!,1
8455,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This literally proves LOOKS ARE EVERYTHING.,1
8456,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,stop using and so much please,1
8457,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She breathes so hard,1
8458,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I appreciate her also bringing up how just like she and others can benefit in this society by how they look, others can be hurt or treated as less than human simply because of how they look to another.",1
8459,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Who said looks are everything,1
8460,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bullshit. Go and tell society in general.,1
8461,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am really glad she told the truth about the racism and sexism in most industries. I have had both praise and privilege of being &quot;a pretty black woman&quot; whatever that is supposed to mean. But also not get opportunities because of my race and being curvy (big/fat). Its all systematic bullying, lack of love and judgement. Find peace within don&#39;t expect anyone to hand you something, do your purpose despite what people judge you as and you will not only be love but find love. Thanks model lady for being brave and telling the real truth.",1
8462,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why do people who give a talk seem like they&#39;ve just ran a mile before doing so,1
8463,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It definitely not the best talk I&#39;ve watched regarding confidence and presentation. BUT I like how a person who has won the genetic lottery regarding looks tries to openly speak about the benefits she&#39;s gaining from it. I think it&#39;s pretty brave and authentic. Nice one!,1
8464,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I call bullshit. It is hard asf to get a lower end job if you arw beyond actractice .,1
8465,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well done for speaking, you must have been very nervous, but you talked from the heart xx",1
8466,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You guys must be very stupid and/or ignorant.<br><br>This women actually critisizes the whole idea of creating a &#39;beautiful-construct&#39; that is surrounding us since decades. <br>She isn&#39;t saying that looks doesn&#39;t matter. She critisizes this very limited point of view, because everyone of us is so much more then just, what we are looking like. (Especially just on some photos)",1
8467,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything but everyone wants to find out for themselves,1
8468,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I can sooo identify with this talk!...,1
8469,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Theres more to life than being really, really, really, ridiculously good looking",1
8470,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"what an inspirational talk, and delivered with such authenticity, thank you!",1
8471,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sure, they aren&#39;t everything but they are something.",1
8472,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is an inspiring video coz i am insecure of my body  coz it hurts when someone calls me weird and i say thank you but inside i say to myself can someone be nicer or accept who i am  ,1
8473,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beauty still matters. Don&#39;t let an old supermodel who can&#39;t compete with the younger ones tell you something else. Beauty will make 80% of your life easier.,1
8474,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
8475,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Us men were very shallow like we care alot about looks but women arent like us they dont care what we look like well to a degree,1
8476,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful soul - thank you for showing me a side to my model daughter that I have not understood or seen . And for helping me to maybe understand her a bit more.,1
8477,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was beautiful and I opening.,1
8478,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But then again if I had a symmetrical face, perfect teeth and clear skin, not a soft pudgy body and acne all over my legs and back I&#39;d probably think looks weren&#39;t everything either... X",1
8479,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just like having money, being beautiful gives you more choices and opportunities than your poorer/uglier counterparts. <br><br>Having more choices and opportunities will probably (in the long run) mean that you end up happier and more fulfilled than those with less choices and opportunities.<br><br>So er...... Yeah. Looks aren&#39;t everything in themselves but they may very well play quite a large part in you being able to get everything you desire.<br><br>Find me the beautiful person who DIDN&#39;T literally exploit their looks in order to forge a career to give this talk and I may find it within myself to admire them for what they&#39;re saying rather than what they DID in their past.<br><br>It&#39;s easy to renounce your former life of living off your looks once you&#39;ve made a healthy financial start for yourself and created those choices and opportunities I was talking about earlier.",1
8480,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good stuff but drop the SJW rant,1
8481,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,is it just me or does she sound very out of breath?,1
8482,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow!  Thank you, Ms Russel for this.  Every teenager needs to her this.<br>Your description of fashion shoots sounds like the industry photo crew only want you as a smart manequin.",1
8483,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I want to study neuroscience. neuropsychology mostly. help mental health, brain health in general.",1
8484,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, your honesty is on point and so admirable. Your character, poise, and the way you carry yourself with such grace are what make you truly beautiful!",1
8485,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,its amazing that shes so aware and willing to bring attention to these issues even though she doesnt have to and it wouldnt benefit her at all! what a brave and amazing and beautiful woman,1
8486,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,everyone whos bashing her choice to give this talk completely missed the whole point of it all,1
8487,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahhaahhahahaahhahahah<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Sure.,1
8488,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"its a great talk but i wish she had elaborated on the gender and racial bias within the fashion industry, especially when it comes to the fashion industry. yes we get the fact that you&#39;re insecure, but there is a whole different narrative taking place for women of color who are criticised for their features such as black women are shown to be insecure about their thick eyebrows, fat lips and big butts but when some becky walks on vs fashiion show parading her huge butt and bushy eyebrows she gets praise, and especially on how this image of perfection that favours rich, white women can especially shape up a lifetime of insecurity and risks for women of color. all you did was complain how fashion was not a good industry, its an argument we have heard many times. we get it. its the same old thing: fashion is for dumb girls, only good girls stay in school. would give this talk a 5/10",1
8489,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,easy for you to say!!!,1
8490,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Umm she still looks hot even with the long skirt,1
8491,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It is the best advantage in life.  Looks are almost everything.,1
8492,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Those young girls ask you if they can be a model when they grow up because they recognize the status and social privileges that good looks bring to women. Yeah, looks are not the most important thing, but they do matter, A LOT.",1
8493,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,FU!,1
8494,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are given the life you can handle. Think about the stress that she has to go through just everyday because she is a model. Sure she gets a lot of benefits but she also has a standard she has to keep up with. She wanted to inform the world on a very important life lesson she learned. Life truly isn&#39;t fair but it&#39;s only unfair if you compare yourself to others. Because their life and destiny is nothing like yours. Live your life how YOU wanna live it and happiness comes with it,1
8495,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Another virtue signaler, apologizing for their &quot;privilege.&quot; This whole totem pole of oppression is ridiculous. Everyone has their privilege in some ways more than others. Height is a privilege of playing basketball, so should the 6&quot;5 basketball player step down and apologize to the 5&quot;5 person who dreams of playing basketball? Does that make the taller bball player evil and oppressive? According to this victimhood logic that&#39;s so popular nowadays, the &quot;privileged&quot; ones are evil and are fully responsible for others&#39; oppression. So let&#39;s bring those down who we think are better than us to feel better about ourselves!",1
8496,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Being model isn&#39;t just about luck. Being a model requires sacrifice and discipline and you need confidence.,1
8497,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,they always say models are dumb. cameron is just amazing. shes a chosen few gifted with inteliigence,1
8498,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,powerful,1
8499,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What I got from this: I&#39;m beautiful, but I have a hard life just like you. Being beautiful does not give you everything. Just a lot. I admit it, but again, looks aren&#39;t everything.<br><br>Also, looks got this many views. If she was not pretty, she would not get this many views.",1
8500,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are most obvious thing people look out. Common sense genius. You&#39;re an idiot model lady.,1
8501,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This a joke right? The world covets looks. This girl could will fit in anywhere. Plus be hired at almost anything. Never seen a model at a low end job. Hmmm. Go figure,1
8502,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,of coruse she makes this about race :D,1
8503,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a pretentious sounding title. It kinda takes away from it for me.,1
8504,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,in the end looks matter coz no one carries x ray machine with them,1
8505,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love your honesty as well as your nervousness ,1
8506,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Awesome,1
8507,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If she more ponder to religion she may find Islam is the best coz of her ideology..,1
8508,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"ummm like we already knew this i think right? well at least i know i did,like idk is this news to any1?",1
8509,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s hard because people expect models to be confident and &#39;perfect&#39; sometimes but to say to the world : &quot;I am a model&quot; and admitting you&#39;re insecure - while on stage - with people already judging you - that&#39;s interesting.. I think she proved her point 100%! She should be a writer :)) &lt;3 so talented at forming and speaking ideas. :) in an honest way.,1
8510,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow very smart model.,1
8511,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,integrity please involve suck house plan rid standard.,1
8512,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People with everything always tend to say &quot;Oh, believe me, it&#39;s not everything.&quot; lol",1
8513,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The irony is that her looks got her on TED!!,1
8514,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good looks does have it pluses but it doesnt guarantee you friends or a good relationship. Most people I know in good relationships are average, sometimes below average looking people. Good looks gets you through the door but doesnt, few people have been able to capitalize on their good looks alone.",1
8515,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything is subject. TBH it is everything in our hyper sexully exposed society.,1
8516,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What she also got for free was to talk at a ted talk for free while saying nothing of value or that would make a change in the world.,1
8517,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Pleas tell me this bullshit when you get a couple of scars on your face.. supermodel,1
8518,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The humanity in her is awesome. I hope she continues to do good work like this that peels the sugarcoat on the surface of social injustice.,1
8519,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I dont get it? Everything she said went against the title? Lmfao,1
8520,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Okay, so I need to be hot to get what I want- got it.",1
8521,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is such an old topic. It&#39;s boring. Most people know that clothing models are unhealthy in lifestyle and body image. labour class consumer capitalism causes all of us to prostitute ourselves.,1
8522,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I accept who am i and always bless myself when i see other worst than me.,1
8523,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I used to think treating people based on their looks was unfair until I realized that looks have much more to do with effort than with luck. Sure there are a handful of people who are too naturally ugly to be helped, or so naturally beautiful that they don&#39;t have to put in the work. But the vast majority of us are in this middle ground where we can be potentially ugly or potentially beautiful depending on how much effort we put in to our appearance. Being good at fashion, skincare, hair, makeup, working out... these are all skills, habits you can develop. So when someone is shunned for being ugly, they&#39;re not being shunned because nature gave them the short end of the stick, they&#39;re being shunned because they&#39;re too lazy to take care of their bodies.",1
8524,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am commenting in 2018..huhuhu.<br><br>Anyway, for those who are arguing that only the rich say &quot;money isn&#39;t everything&quot; and the pretty say &quot;beauty isn&#39;t everything&quot; allow me to show you another perspective of understanding this statement. Money is important. The rich obviously have it easier in this world. Also, money would definitely solve many problems for a poor person and make them happier. <br><br>However, for that rich person, he has already achieved the &quot;wealthy&quot; status but that does not necessarily mean that all will be right for him in this world. I don&#39;t think life or the universe usually goes like &quot;Hmm, this guy is rich so let&#39;s make sure we make life super simple for him.&quot; No. Life will still throw issues to him the same way as a poor person or anyone else! <br><br>Especially for the issues that even money wont really solve, such as depression or self-hate or those issues that really needs you to disregard external factors and really look into yourself. I know that a poor person going through such inner issues may have it worse.. but its not like the rich person can throw money at his internal issues to make them go away. And still if this poor person were to somehow become rich, that wont solve his inner issues. So this rich person will probably be like &quot;Money isnt everything.&quot; And I agree",1
8525,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bunch of morons in comment section ,1

8528,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Look aren&#39;t everything looks hot,1
8529,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why are youtube comments the literal worst,1
8530,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"looks aren&#39;t everything, but everything without looks means nothing xD",1
8531,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,apologetics at it&#39;s best,1
8532,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thinking about this as well, the reason I do not agree with this &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; speech is that those of us who aren&#39;t so good looking are insecure about our looks and those who are very good looking are also insecure about their looks. But insecurity about our looks is not the only problem we face in life. We also face the uncertainty of wondering, while if we will have money to survive and if the pointless struggle of trying to climb up the ladder of wealth will ever amount to anything, we face questions about whether we will find the perfect match for us in life, we face the problem of we will get that job or not when hundreds or even thousands of other people have applied for the same one, and countless other problems. The thing about what this model is saying while still making money off her looks, means she has many of these problems handled already while the rest of us have to face the majority . You see, to me, the insecurity about looks mean nothing because its something most people face anyway, but there are things that this girl gets to avoid because she looks beautiful and that&#39;s why I can&#39;t take her message seriously. Sure she has good intentions at heart but when you say that we shouldn&#39;t be getting ahead because of the way we look yet you yourself are directly benefiting of the way you look, makes your message seem less real.",1
8533,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So just model wanting to rant about race agenda. Ok. You&#39;re hot, that&#39;s it.",1
8534,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ok. i&#39;m curious what she will say when she will be 50 years old,1
8535,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s something tho,1
8536,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is a sad truth that I don&#39;t like to hear so I will just try to forget this,1
8537,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;This picture is a very first picture that I ever took and it&#39;s also the very first time that I had worn a bikini&quot; Then a picture with her grandma WEARING A BIKINI and she says: &quot;This is what I looked like a few months earlier with my grandma&quot;. LIES ALL OVER THE INTERNET!,1
8538,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"looks aren&#39;t everything but when you got them, they are 98% of everything. does that pretty much sum up what she&#39;s saying (I didn&#39;t really watch past the first couple of mins)?",1

8549,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I would believe this more if the title was &quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m ugly af.&quot; It&#39;s easy to say that when you&#39;re a model.",1

8552,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I cried watching this video. For so long I&#39;ve been caught up in my body image, trying to achieve an ideal weight that society dictates, if it&#39;s not my weight it&#39;s my skin, the imperfections on the surface shine through and I always feel like I&#39;m the opposite of societies perception of &quot;beauty&quot;. In my journey to self love and respect I&#39;ve found that no amount of makeup or exercise would ever make me what I want to be as what I wanted to be was not me. In a modern day society of distorted and retouched images it&#39;s so important to realise that beauty really does have nothing to do with what we look like. I just hope that one day the whole world can learn this and that we won&#39;t forever live in a world where those who look a certain way will have privileges that others don&#39;t have.",1

8622,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a honest person,1
8623,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aint everything - says a model,1
8624,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Being beautiful has its major downsides. Looks dont last, youre at your most beautiful through your 20s and then early 30s, and then your superficial outward beauty begins to fade. What happens then? When youve only ever navigated through this world for how pretty you are, youve been conditioned to value yourself through a highly sexualized, others view. when youre not young and hot anymore, you begin to feel like youre not worth as much, and are left a little broken, Im sure. Marilyn Monroe killed herself, and is a good example of this, in its extremes. When youre not constantly valued for your looks, you learn to navigate through life with the things that matter - your personality, smarts, sense of humour, values, and your work on these things more too. Average looking women are probably happier in the long run, worked for what they have without their looks influencing too highly, married to someone that loved them for all of the things they are, both outside and inside, not just because of how beautiful they were when they were in their prime, and have learnt to find a place in the world thats theirs not just in the first 30-40 years for the remaining 30-40 too. Being successful and male is when life treats you best - men are valued for more than looks theyre valued for typical success qualities like leadership, wealth, charm. This usually lasts longer and can be accumulated through time. Men also have the stronger downsides though, like shes mentioned in the video, where a lack of those things meaning a much harder life than a woman. Life is unfair kids, the sooner you figure this out the better you prepare yourselves for it.",1
8625,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Such respect for her! Great message.,1

She also seems worried about the issues of discrimination and body image, but she is somehow cynic by accepting that she is a promotor of that idea of beauty.

8658,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She wasnt kidding when she said shed be honest. Those are some brutal and sensitive topics she brought up, and I only wish she had talked for more about these issues, because I think her point flew over a lot of heads. The point was obviously that what we appear to be on the outside and who we are are not the same, and that changing our outside does not automatically validate or compensate for our inside. We are the total of what we become using what we have  which is so much more than what we look like alone.",1

Just said that she actually had to do that. Over here we can wear what we want without being judged.

8664,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That&#39;s a pretty interesting way to tell a life of a model,1
8665,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think people should be influenced to celebrate who they are, no matter who they are or how they are. To know they are more important than their appearance, to celebrate in their life story and strengths and to be able to identify their gifts in this life. Looks are one gift, but there are so many others. I think the complete picture is being happy and celebrating life...because feeling good, is better than anything to do with appearance.",1
8666,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;What&#39;s it like to be a model?&quot;<br>&quot;Insecure&quot;<br><br>I was thinking - HUNGRY.,1
8667,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You benefit from all the blessings of your innate beauty. Then you say &quot;It does not matter being beautiful&quot;. I am sorry but it is very contradictory, not at all sincere.",1
8668,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t get why people are getting so butthurt about what she has said. She was honest and humble, and she is aware of what the model industry is like. The main thing I don&#39;t get is why people are angry that good looking people have an easy life. First of all you DON&#39;T get to choose they way you look because it&#39;s genetics, secondly the way images are made is fore making people feeling INSECURE, and that&#39;s how this fashion industry works. Beauty may be something that is in partly hidden in the way you look, but mostly it&#39;s about your IDEAS and personality. Why do I say that? Because physical beauty is truly most of the times misleading. Sometimes you get to know people that look hella good and then they open their mouth and it&#39;s like death has suddenly come to talk to you. Other times you are meeting average looking people or maybe bad looking people and they have the most likeable handsome personality. And you know what? I would choose the ones with good personality always over good looking arrogant rude people. This girl here truly has the whole package because she is smart and cute. So it doesn&#39;t make sense pointing at her like she is the problem because honestly, the main problem here is how WE perceive ourselves and if we are confident in our skin. The problem here is that everyone has forgotten about the fact that this sort beauty is made up by SOCIETY, and it&#39;s making everyone of you being angry at the wrong people. You should be angry that someone tries to define beauty for you instead! You should be angry because no one gets to choose what you define beautiful besides of YOURSELF, you should understand that accepting someone&#39;s beauty is NOT making you LESS BEAUTIFUL. I don&#39;t like bragging about myself, I used to have all these kind of behaviors where I would pick someone to give the blame for the way I looked. You know what? I can still feel beautiful and appreciate somebody elses beauty, I can decide what&#39;s beautiful for ME. And I can understand that PHYSICAL BEAUTY is truly SUPERFICIAL because at some point youth will fade and I will become non attractive. People will chose to stay with me because of my personality traits, because maybe I&#39;m kind, maybe I&#39;m caring, I&#39;m fun to be around etc... My looks don&#39;t stop me from working hard, aspiring to things, having interests, having a family, having good friends, having a good life. You don&#39;t even try to look at it from a different perspective! You don&#39;t even care. Why would you, the only thing people nowadays look at are themselves. Have you ever thought that most good looking people are insicure because most of the people treat them like the don&#39;t have a mind of their own, like they don&#39;t have the right to feel sad, like they don&#39;t have ideas, that they can&#39;t be smart? How many women have been ignored as potentially good for a place of work because people think they aren&#39;t enough smart because of their looks? Come on people, it&#39;s freaking 2018 and you are still behaving like this? No offense, but it&#39;s so disappointing reading these comments! And don&#39;t you think these models are ethereal presences because they are not. They are HUMAN beings with flaws just like everybody else. They tell you to reach up to some standards that are non existent and unbearable, and most of you still give the blame to models and accept this instead of finding your own way of percieving things. And that surely it&#39;s not the blame of this light hearted woman here. IT&#39;S YOURS.",1

8692,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That was a great speech. I liked the part where she showed the model pics and her everyday pics hanging out. That actually was very powerful! Ive never seen that. But the truth is, looks may not be everything to her since she has it but to the rest of the 99% of the population, it does mean a lot; and it literally is everything. Its like a rich person saying money isnt everything. To them it isnt because they have it, but to everyone it literally is everything. Its all subjective to each persons point in life, so making blanking statements doesnt work, especially when it comes to beauty as beauty is such a huge role in everyones lives. It dictates how they feel about themselves everyday. <br>Its a fact that the more attractive you are, the more opportunity you have in life. So I appreciate her talk, and it was interesting how she said models are the most insecure. I never thought of it that way since I figured they were secure in their beauty.

Sure they add a lot. Beauty is a mystery but not whole subjective as some say.  Why should people be &quot;attractive&quot; anyway? If it&#39;s so important, such a key advantage, why didn&#39;t evolution turn everyone into beautiful people through it&#39;s twists and turns over thousands of years? If I&#39;m lucky the model will read this. Probably not.",1

And the more I look around, lately I have been wondering how different my social life would be if I were society&#39;s definition of pretty, if I were white with blue eyes or whatever. And based off of what I&#39;ve seen I have come to think my social life would be better. People may say outward appearance or race doesn&#39;t matter but that is not how they live their lives. I just had a weird thought to counter my denial; I don&#39;t believe in reincarnation but what if there was a time in my life where I looked like society&#39;s definition of pretty but life wasn&#39;t all I thought it would be so I wished I looked like how I do now.",1

8730,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She had some good points, mostly about her personal experience, but it makes me very sad that she feels she needs to &quot;apologize/acknowledge&quot; something she has no control over. She was born gorgeous, she shouldn&#39;t feel she has to apologize for or minimize it. Life isn&#39;t fair and everyone needs to accept that and move on.",1

8732,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,There is nothing wrong in using your looks to get a head of the game.,1
8733,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What she&#39;s saying is so true tho, I started studying fashion photography since last year, and there are so many factors to a photoshoot that make up the photo you see on magazines and online. There&#39;s so many factors on it, like they drink a lot of liquid and very little solid food for a week before the shoot to make their skin tighten more  to their muscles. They go through a vigorous workout that takes up 3 hours of their every day at least not counting their very restricted diet. This is on top of their good genes already, sometimes genetically chosen genes. Not counting the consulting of diet, exercise, make up, face wash routine, what you wear everyday, everything fitted for just that person. Not to mention the steps of pre planning, photoshoots and post production? God that is a lot of work man. <br>There&#39;s a reason why modelling is a job, it is such hard work, it just batters your inside so much, insecurities and constructions all heightened. You might look beautiful on the outside and you might be enjoying luxurious life styles, but most can&#39;t completely let go and go crazy and do whatever they want.",1

Or being told she&#39;s only where she is solely because she&#39;s pretty, being assumed she&#39;s dumb, getting creepy pms/ catcalled frequently, missing out on dating amazing people because they assumed she&#39;s way out of their league.

In twenty years from now,  that definition will change again as it has in the past. Therefore,  looks really aren&#39;t everything. Furthermore in our current society, it is actually far more about how presentable we are,  how do we socialize, do we have sociable personalities?  Those are what work in the long run.  Looks have some leeway but if your personality is rude,  that automatically will shut people off.  Sure they may act nice around you,  but in the long run,  they won&#39;t be there when you need them most.  So yes looks aren&#39;t everything because,  honestly what are &quot;looks&quot; anyways? They are clearly different for each person.",1

For example those who are insecure about their image due to being overweight or underweight, go to the gym and bulk up or bulk down. Either way, its going to take effort and hard work. Eating healthy should be the number one reason for doingso, but doing it to look good and to make you feel better about your image a good incentive also. I&#39;ve seen very good looking people both men and women who lack confidence and self esteem and thus they don&#39;t see the beauty they possess, yet they are very nice people. We all have flaws and we all need to improve ourselves inside and out and keep on growing as a person. This was a beautiful talk. BTW...this model was nothing spectacular. She was average looking to me. Yet with all the production done on her from clothes to hair to makeup to shoots etc,..... you see her transformation to someone unrecognizable on the streets if you knew her. If they did the same to any one of us, we would look as gorgeous.But if you don&#39;t have the &quot;confidence&quot; from within and the &quot;don&#39;t care what people think of me attitude&quot; (provided you&#39;re not hurting anyone) than it will always hold you back in life. One more thing....sometimes some of our flaws brings out a unique character about us that others don&#39;t possess or look like. So the real question is....is this a flaw or just your own unique beauty?",1
8762,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everytime I watch one of these ted talks videos i hate myself at the end. I wasn&#39;t going to watch this one but said oh well what can it hurt. Grrr.,1
8763,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That&#39;s refreshing,1
8764,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,2018,1
8765,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything. Yes but they are the first things.,1
8766,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was pretty interesting. I love how grounded she is.,1
8767,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Judging based on appearance is why racism exists.,1
8768,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"BS. If the other is not attracted to you, you&#39;re setting yourself up for disaster!",1
8769,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its so easy for her to say what she said when she had all that,1
8770,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Haha, the fact that she thinks she won &quot;a genetic lottery&quot; makes me happy.",1
8771,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks ARE everything. Believe me, I am NOT a model.",1
8772,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really enjoyed this video  Cameron is a great speaker! My only complaint is that I wish she had spoken for another 10 or 20 minutes!! I would have been fascinated with a more in-depth examination of the subject ,1
8773,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Im a man but she is absolutely amazing, she my of won the genetic lottery and she may be a highly successful model but to still have such a level head is just astounding, what a kind caring loveable person! <br><br>Dont aspire to be perfect, good looking, slim, have shinier hair or bigger boobs, aspire to be someone like this woman, change the world with your words not your looks",1
8774,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s right. Trust me.,1
8775,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,when youtube knows a lot about you and won&#39;t stop recommending vids,1
8776,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I want to be a model...and her husband,1
8777,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s a model? Her thickness is 0/10.,1
8778,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It is very important though,1
8779,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Insecurity is caused by the chemical imbalances in your brain during puberty, for the most part. Even though most animals admire certain body parts that lead to physical attraction, which leads to procreation (symmetrical features on a body is a sign of good genetics, which is the only reason for physical attraction),  humans are the only animals that actually seem to care enough to spend money on alterations. As for me, I find no desire to engage in &quot;sexual&quot; acts by messing with, licking, or touching body parts. This includes genitalia. Humans are the only animals that put genitals in their mouths, by the way. How stupid is that?",1
8780,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y," ))))<br>    .      ,       ))))",1
8781,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i honestly didn&#39;t think it was that hard to miss her genuine need-to-be heard point in this video. But reading upon the comments, I have the wrong assumptions about people&#39;s iq levels and comprehension. lol fucktards.",1
8782,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s an amazing soul.,1
8783,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,so - she is pretty and gets everything for free but she is insecure like basically every other human? seems bad...,1
8784,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,True beauty!! ,1
8785,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is wrong. Looks are everything with a bit of personality.,1
8786,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Don&#39;t really need any hot celeb or model to say this. Almost every beautiful or hot person I know has been cheated on. The ones who haven&#39;t, have been the most wonderful people to be around and great personality.",1
8787,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This was such a powerful talk. Thoughtful, intelligent, vulnerable, courageous. This woman may have &quot;won the genetic lottery&quot; and be aesthetically beautiful - but she also has a beautiful mind.",1
8788,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron Russell is very beautiful to look at, but she&#39;s also got a beautiful soul. I wish her happiness.",1
8789,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am not trying to be hateful of this girl, but I clicked on this video to find out why exactly looks aren&#39;t everything. All I learned was that the modeling industry isn&#39;t real and that she is insecure. Looks affect my life everyday but I never had plans to be a model, so that point doesn&#39;t help. I am insecure about my looks/ always paying attention to how I look yet I am still ugly, so that point doesn&#39;t help me either because ugly people can be just as insecure. So this video didn&#39;t even help me to understand why looks aren&#39;t everything. Maybe I missed one of her points but this video did not change my outlook at all",1
8790,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Money isn&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m rich LOL . No single quality is everything, but having them are a great advantage in life, let&#39;s be  honest about it.",1
8791,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She was hired because she was a rich kid. She didn&#39;t need their money, is the main reason she got hired. Pretty has has nothing to do with it. Skinny is first",1
8792,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She doesn&#39;t know anything about look in fact she is ugly. Every person tall could be a model.,1
8793,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the problem with her argument is that she says its bad that only 27% of the models out of the 600 something were non white. first of all, less than half of america is non white, so those numbers shouldnt be high from the get go. second, most whites tend to naturally be beautiful, while most non whites arent, and all of it has to do with evolution. we are programmed to mate and be attracted to beautiful people, which are most likely white depending on what you find attractive. so it has absolutely nothing to do with racism or oppression, it is 100 percent based on our ancestors, genetics and evolution.",1
8794,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I liked the dress,1
8795,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but looks ARE something,1
8796,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,amazing,1

8798,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m WAS GORGEOUS IN MY 20S.  ALL THE WOMEN WOULD STARE AT ME WHEN I FIRST GO INTO A CLUB...EVEN WENT TO A MODELING AGENCY..AND WAS NOT PICKED UP... WHEN THEY SAY BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER ....IT IS TRUE...YOU CAN BE GORGEOUS BUT NOT EVERY ONE IS GOING TO SEE IT.... SO YOU NEED OTHER SKILLS ....YOU CANNOT BE SHY AND YOU CANNOT BE STUPID....LOOKS CAN ONLY TAKE YOU SO FAR...",1
8799,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wanna hug you you are amazing ,1

8803,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,For men it&#39;s different Mexicans have a saying.. Take away my poverty because the money will take away my ugliness.,1
8804,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks like just saying either of the two opinions (looks are and aren&#39;t everything), whether the one who says it were good looking or not, it will trigger some people. It&#39;s a very dividing subject it seems, so maybe throw my own two cents in.<br><br>Looks matter very much, but they are not everything. I think I&#39;m a decent looking guy. Acknowledging this gives me a lot confidence and it clearly helps making people like me from the start along with other benefits, and I do recognize the advantage. When making lasting friendships and accomplices though, looks matter little. Or when trying to be actually competent in any skill.<br>When we humans meet new people, we more or less subconsciously value them by their looks, because that&#39;s the first thing we see in them. We don&#39;t see their personality or skills or values from their face alone, and we cannot judge a person by their height.",1
8805,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are absolutely everything, it fucking sucks but its true. I&#39;m (sort of) happy that more and more people are realizing this instead of spreading &quot;personality&quot; and &quot;confidence&quot; bullshit.",1

8808,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,it may not be everything but it&#39;s one of the most important things! i know because i have experienced both sides! forget the modelling of film industry! Normal people also tend to judge or be unfair to the people they consider less attractive! Attractive people tend to get favored a lot. So no this video does not make me feel any better,1
8809,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are everything, you proved it when you changed your clothing. I give you credit for trying to educate us, but the bottom line from day one, the good looking has a greater voice. You dressed up but showed all your proud sexy photo&#39;s that you don&#39;t like. Right?",1
8810,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Iska has bigger breast but what Iska said was disorganised and mostly a lie. This girl Cameron, her talk is substantial.",1

8812,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So beautiful!,1
8813,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You being a model destroys credibility...right,1
8814,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I cant speak for other little girls nut i suspect when they say they want to be models when they grow up, maybe they mean they want to look modelesque and be privy to all the things that includes. If she ever decides to stop modelling, she could def do voicepver or something. Good speech.",1

8826,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you are beautyfull , people asume that you are a food person. When I step into a room full of people, every body thinks that I&#39;m a criminal. So jeah looks are powerfull",1

8828,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just sounds like another woman apologizing for not being a fat SJW woman of color.,1
8829,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was brave and beautiful. Thumbs up,1
8830,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What if you don&#39;t have the looks and the personality. What happens then?,1
8831,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I find her natural look a lot more appealing, and definitely more approachable than her the &quot;model&quot; version.",1
8832,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You say that cause you have looks only reason why your even ackowlaged is because your good looking if you wearnt good looking you&#39;d not be noticed at all,1
8833,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So inspiring ,1
8834,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t get how she can be insecure when she basically gets told she&#39;s perfect every time a photographer snaps a picture of her. Why would a photographer invite her to a photoshoot if she wasn&#39;t pretty?!,1

8842,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lmao at the title. They are everything and we all know that. More important than race. Good looks mean you are treated well and live netter,1
8843,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Your 100 percent right. What is everything? Answer.......nothing . But being an attractive woman, makes people , most people, nicer, more helpful, given more opportunities. Yes I get it it&#39;s a curse also. Try being a regular, mediocre, for a while, these people are happy, loving, just as you. Everybody has trials. This video sucks because of its content.",1

8849,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thanks 4 sharing,1
8850,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"For the people who are shaming her : I think she was trying to send a positive message here. Shes trying to say that everything you see isnt everything you want (something along the lines of that) shes saying you dont need to have everything to be the best. When she says Im on the stage because Im privileged (or what ever she says) shes saying that the people who have all of that, get more in return the the people who dont. Thats what I think anyway.<br><br>But I think this video has a great message. Especially the part about her explaining how the picture of her was a construction rather a picture of her.",1

All it states is that looks are powerful and you can get out of a freaking ticket aka a lot of what you want out of life by being appealing physically. That society today has distorted the idea so much of what the ideal man and woman should look like. She didn&#39;t propose any sort of solution or good advice, any alternative perhaps. She just pretty much said- my looks are what got me here. But even though I get photographed like crazy I have insecurities just like every other human being.

8912,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"All these people saying &#39;Easy for her to say looks aren&#39;t everything, she&#39;s a model!&#39; literally missed the point of the talk.<br><br>Yes, that&#39;s also the first thing that came to my mind. But then she intentionally flipped it - &quot;I am incredible privileged because my looks ARE what people judge me off. It is BECAUSE I am so beautiful, white, tall -  because of pure luck on my side, that I have what I do. Therefore looks DO matter, but why? It&#39;s the arbitrary and unfair weight we put on it. So we shouldn&#39;t put as much weight onto looks. Looks don&#39;t matter.&quot;",1

8920,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,And what infuriates me is people (without realizing the consequences) keep idolizing good looking people in real life as well and romanticize over how members of the opposite gender go crazy over so and so. People express their shock to good looking singles about their relationship status. Such statements give a wrong impression to the impressionable minds. (teenagers and young adults) Why don&#39;t people make it clear everywhere on every platform that looks is only part of the package?,1

Also when i walk alone on the streets some guys with their cars stop just to say &quot;Hi&quot; to me or tell me something gross. The people in the shopping center have never treated me bad, they always are     really kind to me but not with my friends.

There are plenty of beautiful people who are shallow and unhappy, and plenty of people who arent conventionally attractive but extremely content and successful. We all find our place in this world based on our natural talents, attributes, and skills, so to pretend that beauty is the only great advantage a human can have is completely misguided.<br><br>I say this as a former cheerleader for whom appearance used to be a huge though not the toppriority. I work at a tech company now, and no one could care less what you look like. They care about your resilience, organizational skills, health, and job performance.

8947,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Okay. So I&#39;ve been called gorgeous and pretty. It doesn&#39;t really benefit my success. Although it does help my self esteem.

One day when i fell in love with a beautiful girl, blonde haired, blue eyed, i thought at the beginning man just give up she wont like you . But at a party i remember she lost her bracelet and asked if I didnt see it somewhere. I said no but i decided to help her. While we were searching we started to talk etc and I made her laugh many times, like we spent a good time. And at the end i took her number and we started to talk everyday, and she told me she just broke up with her bf. I was like ok, we started to hang out everything for about 4-5 months and then she became my girlfriend. The first day i was like wtf is just happening, like wow I couldnt believe it. Like i wanted to know why she said yes, like im not that handsome guy but i didnt ask<br>But then she travelled to another place to live in and me too i travelled. And where i am today, there was also a beautiful girl but i didnt fall in love with her we were just friends for me. But one day a friend of hers told me she likes me and she wants to be more than my friend, i was like wtf again, like what is wrong with her . And when she became my girlfriend i asked her one day seriously  im not handsome so why do you love me she laughed and said  that is why, because u are so dumb and that makes me smile everyday. I just wanted to say that it doesnt matter if you are handsome or not, all you need is to be yourself and make her have a great time every time you are together and i promise she will likes you, but dont suck her . But i also pay attention, a lot, at what i wear, like dress good, not only for the girls but also for you",1

8961,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hating on someone who is physically beautiful is no different than insulting or ignoring someone unattractive. The point is neither of them had any say in the matter so why would you use that to form an opinion on their merits.   If you have an issue with your looks or hers, voice your complaints to God. <br><br>The truth is that as humans, we dont choose what we find physically attractive. It is instinctive. Its natural and conclusive within a split second. Society doesnt tell us what we naturally feel. Society presents to us what is widely considered attractive by most people. Humans can be manipulated in many ways, but saying we can be mindfucked into being instinctively attracted to someone is a myth. <br><br>And yes its true that over time when we get to know someone well their virtues become what we find attractive in spite of their looks being what we are not attracted to. Many can get past that. I cannot unfortunately  And just like my attractions are done without thought, so is my inability to have an intimate relationship with a woman if no physical attraction exists. <br><br>If more people would acknowledge truth, and determine a persons merits only on what is within that persons control, we would be so much better odd.",1

It&#39;s one of the many contradictions created by the fact that we tend to admire punchlines that sound right but we&#39;d rather not take them literally in our everyday lives. So we basically feel good about ourselves saying one thing and doing another. The brutal truth on the subject is, whether we like it or not, good looks will make your life a million times easier compared to someone who has the exact same chances in life as you but doesn&#39;t have the looks.

8989,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ms. Russell back in October of 2017 used her Instagram account to expose sexual assault, misconduct, and abuse in the modeling industry.  It is related to what she spoke about in this TED talk. I hope and pray this woman figures out the truth  she is definitely on the path and Im confident, if she does, will be able to have a powerful influence for good in the world.<br>     The genetic lottery she won is really not based on her looks.  This is actually a flaw in her thinking.  The lottery she is cashing in on is the brokenness of mankind.  There is nothing wrong with being beautiful.  It is not, in-and-of-itself, superficial.  How we react to beauty can be very much superficial!<br>     The legacy she speaks of is the real problem, not her physical appearance.  The FACT that 53% of 13-year-old girls and 78% of 17-year-old girls dont like their bodies is a reflection of this legacy.  We value modeling (and similar professions) more so than other professions.  Her example career paths of President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet implies this.  Professions that are significant and should be valued are not nearly as honored, valued, nor well paid as models, athletes, musicians, or actors.  For example, my wife is a high-school teacher and although our society DOES honor this profession, somewhat, it is not honored or valued financially nor with social capital, like modeling, acting, or professional athletics.<br>     The problem, the &quot;legacy&quot;, is the human condition.  This is not going to change.  I am not a pessimist; Im actually an optimistic person, but human nature is broken, fallen - if you will.  We want money, looks, we want to be accepted and liked, we want power, pleasure, and the like.  We seek such things as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness at almost any cost - individualized of course.  When out of control or unchecked, we call these things greed, selfishness, and lust.  And if honest, we all struggle and some just give in. <br>     Ms. Russells cashing in on the legacy is just another aspect of the legacy.  If people didnt OVERLY reward others based on physical beauty, there would be no cashing in like she explains.  Oh, we would still need models and they would be paid, but it wouldnt be what she has experienced, the abuse she shared over Instagram wouldnt occur as much, and young girls wouldnt struggle as much with not liking their bodies. (Note the song by Jonny Diaz entitled, More Beautiful You)<br>     The ONLY solution is metaphysical.  On individual bases, we must change and become people of character, integrity, and we must develop godly values.   But the ultimate solution is found in two Aramaic words:  maran th&#39;.  These words, in their transliterated Koine Greek form, are found in 1 Corinthians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=16m22s"">16:22</a>.  Until the ultimate solution occurs, we must each grow and develop as individual people, so that we control our more base, ugly but very human impulses.  This is true for models as well as the rest of us.  I pray Ms. Russell continues to grow and wish I could help her do so, personally, because of the powerful influence she would have for good - an influence that works for the good. Such influence also works because of the &quot;legacy&quot;. I guess that&#39;s called a paradox.",1

And now to this day , I see myself with no insecurities anymore because I know who I am as a person on the inside and then I see how much beauty I have on the outside .

So... either the diversity of runways increased by 600% in the last 10 years or... when she says non-white she is referring only to black. Which was at over 8% in 2016, which is getting close to representative for their percentage of the population. As far as the stop and frisk thing goes, many black and latino lives were saved by stop and frisk because 96% of shooting victims and 97% of shooting suspects are black or latino.

9020,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks isn&#39;t everything - but helps a lot in selling everything else you&#39;ve got.,1
9021,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m conservative, and she actually made some really good points. I love her intellect!",1
9022,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Subbed because of the power of speech &amp; truth. God bless this woman. She is brave and bold. One of the greatest role model of our future!!! GB,1
9023,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I never thought about it that way, that models are mostly insecure about their appearance. I didnt believe it at first but it actually makes sense... Im sorry for those models who have to go through that. ",1
9024,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i always thought that if i become white or have good body then i became happy.....thats things always depressed but now i love me...i m happy ,1
9025,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what a beautiful person and i&#39;m referring to her internal beauty.,1
9026,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wonderful talk! Good job on being honest, you definetly were genuine on that stage!",1
9027,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,the talk is undermined by the fact that she&#39;s still a model,1
9028,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful people say &#39;looks doesn&#39;t matter&#39;<br>Rich people say &#39;money doesn&#39;t matter&#39;<br>But for a common man in a society these things can&#39;t be ignored,1
9029,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Sorry to be rude but... easy for her to say! She&#39;s super pretty!,1
9030,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why are there people who encourage her to talk about this here. I could care less about a privileged woman with superficial insecurities.,1
9031,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;You want to be like a girl that is in a magazine, even she was never that girl.&quot;",1
9032,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are everything. Don&#39;t let these politically correct bullshitters tell you otherwise. Serial killers and rapists who are very handsome get lighter sentences and more allowances than serial killers and rapists who are fat and ugly. There was even one story where this very good-looking felon was getting all this positive female attention (some of whom wanted to date and marry him) even though he was convicted of a serious crime. Looks are everything. In fact, looks are much more powerful than intelligence, sense of humor, personality style, family background, etc. in terms of how you get around in society, professionally and romantically.",1
9033,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I loved this talk but one thing I wish she would&#39;ve answered is why SHE became a model, and why she continues to do it. I mean yeah she says that she was qualified for the job because she won the gene lottery, but she still had to voluntarily do it. So why? What&#39;s the reason she said yes? What answer could a little girl give her that would be valid?",1
9034,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Studies and research has shown that the better looking you are, the higher your salary. This does not necessarily mean tall and beautiful. It means well groomed, average weight, well dressed and self-confident. Better looking is how others perceive us, but we can control that perception by simply making the most of what we have. It is really that simple. Shallow? Maybe.  But unfortunately true.",1
9035,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Guys ! How to sign in this lecture??? I wish I could have a speech about &quot;education and numbers&quot; at TED TALK&#39;s  stage but I dont know how to sign and prepare and the conditions ! Please help me! @TED,1

9053,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well, first of all, looks aren&#39;t everything in deed. In a world, where all people are awakened and mindful about themselves, others and life itself, looks wouldn&#39;t matter at all. Then all people would know, that we are way more than our bodies and clothes.<br>However, we are NOT living in such kind of world. As a matter of fact, we never did. Even if someone tells you , that he or she is not influenced by someone&#39;s physical appearence, it&#39;s a lie. How often have you dated people, who doesen&#39;t fit your ideal?<br>And if you did, maybe you just hadn&#39;t any other options. Many of us are influenced by looks and appearence unconsciously. It happens so fast, that most of us are not even able to recognize it consciously. To be exact: It happens in a quarter of a second. <br>Now, for a person, who looks like Cameron, it&#39;s simply not possible to tell, whether looks matter or not. You can only do this, if you are someone, who doesn&#39;t appear to be pretty in the eyes of society. Someone who doesn&#39;t represent the current ideal. <br>She will never be able to feel and understand what it&#39;s like to not attract attention easily and not  to stand out. As far as I know, she grew up in a pretty good environment. Her parents are both entrepreneurs and she had never to struggle financially. <br>On top of that, she was obviously very lucky in winning good genetics. <br>Now tell this story to someone, who is neither physically a feast for the eyes nor lives in such priviliged surroundings. Those guys will always have to work harder and longer. Period. They will tell you, that in most societies looks do matter. <br>Sorry Cameron. You tried your best, but this kind of speech is not something, that YOU should deliver. It&#39;s just not authentic.",1

9057,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The reason so few models are non white is cuz non-whites usually aren&#39;t as attractive as whites,1

9059,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nah she ugly,1
9060,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its unbelievable how people are obsessed with looks. Like they did something special to make it happen while its just winning a appearance lotter.<br>It proofs how dumb the majority of humankind is...,1

9079,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything, but they definitely are something. I actually clicked this video cause she looked pretty in the thumbnail..",1
9080,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow what a sweetie pie! She has so much compassion in her heart,1
9081,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,These people are so overrated thats  You are just another colourless human being. Nothing special! ,1
9082,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Powerful. ,1
9083,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why does she sound so out of breath?,1
9084,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Is this a joke?   10 spent perpetuating bs and NOW she wants some credibility?  Sorry sweetie.  That&#39;s not how it works.,1
9085,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It took her 10 years to come forward...,1
9086,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wait so she spent the first 7 minutes braging on how easy her life was due to her looks. Then they title the video &quot;Looks dont matter&quot;,1
9087,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In one word I&#39;ll summarize it ,  Beatifull , just beatifull",1
9088,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The title of this video alone made me initially hate it. But this was the opposite of what I expected. The honesty and acknowledgement of the advantages her looks have granted her validates everything else she says. As someone naturally skeptical of the physically attractive, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself agreeing with her.",1
9089,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Powerful message, but keep in mind this is Easy to say when you&#39;re attractive. Just like a lot of rich people come out and say money isn&#39;t everything to a bunch of financially poor viewers.",1

9094,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is amazing Cameron.<br>Thank you,1
9095,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This should be shown in high school to all girls.,1
9096,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,shes not that pretty,1
9097,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Awesome presentation, very confident yet humble. Beautiful!",1
9098,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Better to be happy than to stride to look pretty when you already are! :D,1
9099,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So... would this talk have the same impact if this woman were fat and ugly?,1
9100,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"lol believe me looks aren&#39;t everything, iv&#39;e just built a career on it.",1
9101,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Money arent everything <br>Believe me. I am a millionaire.,1

9103,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Some believe looks are everything, some arent. Its okay, people have opinions and we shouldnt judge them or tell which one is wrong and which isnt. We all are entitled to our opinions and believe. My opinion regarding this is: looks are everything only if you let them be. You are not who you were born or what you have, you are who you choose to be. Your choice matters, they shape you.",1
9104,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,then why do all girls always fall for the hot dude? didnt watch your video. no need to. same old,1

9110,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Cameron is talking from her heart. It totally makes sense.,1

Strangers who, after 3 seconds of MAYBE thinking about your looks, will forget you even exist? You want to impress them? I dont get it... we live in a world where we are constantly shown how we should look to be happy, to be successful, to be the sight if envy, to find a husband/wife. And some how although these images are conceptualized and created by insecure people who will have a harder time looking this way than we do, we just accept it and allow it to steel so much out of out lives? I feel like the world has been nurturing a self-obsessed society of insecure judgmental people who constantly worry about what random strangers think of them? And its ridiculous... Ive lost so much worrying what random people might think of me... when the reality is; theyre so self-obsessed too theyre not even thinking about you, because theyre too busy (like you) thinking and worry about what you might think of them.",1

9130,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A wonderful talk about image. As an elementary school teacher I see girls and boys struggle with their self image as young as 5. And I&#39;m absolutely convinced that a great percentage of the problem is also due to their parents misconception that beauty equals success. I teach in NY and I think it would be great for you to bring this talk to both middle and high school kids.,1

9132,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks might not be everything, but the fact remains (supported by scientific research) that people that are considered attractive generally have more success in life and have more chances at success in life. And this goes for pretty much all aspects in life, which is socializing, work, love, etc. I&#39;m not saying that less attractive people can&#39;t have a happy, successful life.

Some people play up or play down of what they have in themselves until once it&#39;s gone... then, it becomes a real big deal.

9154,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I liked how she talked about never having a boyfriend and being a white woman. She is a model for crying out loud. I wonder what the singer P!NK would think about that? lol.,1

I feel annoying to check a fashion magazine, nor watch tv. Somehow I have a very bad test of anything fake. And somehow TED brought me here.<br>My opinion here is : she enjoyed her time well as she wanted, did happily every nasty thing been asked. Now that age alarming her to leave stage - she is now doing a damage management - trying to evolve status for a new business or for those businesses she works for . Openness vulnerability of digital world will force many businesses to shape new way on the surface.

Modeling photos are a mere illusion to me and as i know that, it does not attract me as a life goal, just as job goal to make people look like that. She is totally on point. Realize it sooner than later, dont miss out on the important moments trying to look like that insta chick cuz that cant be achieved without filters and 100 other additions. Life passes by...",1

9178,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There are lots of research showing that nice looking people have more advantage. Nice looking professors get better rated in schools, even job interviews are easier for nice looking people. The list goes on and on. I have experienced that myself many times. I help people and my nice looking friend gets the credit. Even in families many times the nice looking kids get more attention. I took a very nice looking girl with me to a party and it was amazing how people treated me better. People that never talked to me came to say hi. I did my own experiment with dating website. I created a fake profile and put a picture of an Italian model. I tried to act bad and say bad things to the women and pretend I was ajerk, but they kept writing and wanted to know me better. Meanwhile my own profile got hardly any hit. Doesn&#39;t matter what Cameron Russell says, she is a model but not a scientist. Research shows that looks really help people in life.",1
9179,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She forgot to mention the mistreatment she gets from average looking people. She forgot to mention all the envy, and hate she had to deal with in her life, by other women or by men.  She forgot to mention the struggles she faced growing up and being left out! because she was more beautiful then most people. She forgot to mention a lot of the negatives that come with being beautiful!",1

I can mention numerous occasions where looks have gotten me jobs, girlfriends, friends, discounts, experiences I would not have gotten otherwise etc. It just opens a lot of doors.<br>So I guess you can look at it many ways.

It only outlines how little she can acknowledge it.<br>Oh, you&#39;re insecure? You are the person who produces insecurity in others.",1

9197,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Look does not matter?  LMAO...........  Well if you she was short and ugly or average looking she wouldn&#39;t be a model and be singing a different tune.  She was lucky to born tall and good looking and she has a good personality.  But back to reality most women would not even give you second look if you&#39;re short and ugly.,1
9198,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she should read more about EVOLUTION theory .,1
9199,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she dont know the problem about beauty and ugly is not just the social thing . its also the evolution thing.that have to be that. she talking the fair among the people. i cant understand, there is no fair. because  this is world . just fighting. no fair.",1

They&#39;ll surely repeat those century-old words: <b>&quot;Skills can be trained but appearances can&#39;t be changed&quot;.</b> Changing those fixed mindset isn&#39;t gonna be possible, at least in the near future...",1
9202,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s so honest!!,1

9208,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Powerful woman great speech,1
9209,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes..... but not TED talk worthy imo,1
9210,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"While she acknowledged how her race and DNA played a role with her landing a career in modelling, which I agree with, she didn&#39;t acknowledge her class privilege and connections at all.  This skews the perception of how she became a model for lots of people in that you may think it was mainly her supposedly elite-level beauty and race that lead her to be &quot;discovered&quot;. <br><br>Her mother is a wealthy, powerful and well-connected woman who was one of the co-founders of ZipCar and an MIT alum.  She even gave a TED Talk.  Her mother also had a friend that worked in the Ford Modeling Agency to help Cameron get her foot in the door.  <br><br>Through her family&#39;s alumni status, wealth and connections, she was able to enjoy an ivy league education, after attending a prestigious private high school.  Cameron isn&#39;t the only one, you can look at several other model bios and find the same thing.  You could make an argument that coming from a wealthy well connected family was an even bigger factor than simply being white.  Don&#39;t get too dazzled by these people; they&#39;re not as talented/beautiful as they claim.",1

9214,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s all relative.,1
9215,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She said that she is insecure, does not have self confidence. Also she is on the stage and has dare to say this? I do not think so...",1
9216,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I LOOOVE her. Shes also the woman who is addressing the sexual assault &amp; harassment in the modeling industry on her instagram. Shes such a good person. ,1

9227,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It seems like there is a lack of oxygen...lol,1
9228,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She didn&#39;t transform what I thought about her though. I was less distracted but the initial impression of attraction and also sympathy for her nervousness. She&#39;s wrong about a lot of things, as much as I do like her. You can change your appearance. She&#39;s so used to focusing on beauty she does it without realizing her whole day makes her look the way she does. She says she got a fake tan before she said she&#39;s there for being a pretty white girl, a contradiction. She says people are attracted to tall slim figures, but men don&#39;t care about height and like curves. She&#39;s very attractive despite being a tall, slim( androgynous ) body type. Which is why she&#39;s a model. She&#39;s intelligent, but because she&#39;s a model she doesn&#39;t understand normal perspective and I don&#39;t believe her.",1

9232,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I found her very genuine and this could not have been easy for her. The only part that confused me is when she said she is insecure because she always has to worry about how she looks. If that is an issue for her, then don&#39;t be a model...period. Put your hair in a ponytail and do something that doesn&#39;t make you feel insecure about yourself. Just because she is beautiful, she is not destined to be a model for the rest of her life...there are choices. She is choosing to feel insecure by choosing to stay in the industry that focuses on appearances only.",1
9233,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I have a good friend who is strikingly beautiful. It&#39;s been interesting being friends with her. Going to stores, restaurants etc she will be served first even if she walked in last. Everything comes easy to her. The issue lately is that she&#39;s aging, and not well btw. She&#39;s struggling with understanding that much of her success came from her looks. She was somehow unaware that her looks opened doors for her, and those doors are not opening quite so easily now.",1

As a person with insecurity as big as an ocean myself, I can see it in her. <br>This talk, not only her speech but also with her body language and her demeanor, shows as that she&#39;s also human who feel emotions. She is not just am image or a product on the covers of magazine.<br><br>I want to meet her in real life. She looks like a great, kind, intelligent, and funny person.",1

Trust me, we are all the biggest critics of ourself. We perceive others differently than they do themselves. We think that we aren&#39;t good enough, because of something that isn&#39;t perfect.<br>Let me tell you a story<br><br>So, there was this really attractive girl, I never really talked to her, cause she was kinda reserved but on the other hand really physically attractive. So time passes by and we became &quot;friends&quot; and I was hoping for more. I couldn&#39;t give myself a &quot;push&quot; and talk to her about that, cause I thought that I wasn&#39;t good enough and she could have had anyone. I regret this till this day, 2 years later. We both moved to a different country, I have never seen her since. But I was being told (1 year ago) that she felt the same thing for me, which was probably the weirdest feeling that I&#39;ve ever had. You knew on the other hand that she liked you but on the other side you knew, that you completely messed it up. Why am I telling you this story? Cause we both had problems with our self-esteem and that was the only thing between a relationship. If you&#39;re ever in this situation, talk to her/him, you&#39;re good enough.<br>Thanks for reading, D.",1

There&#39;s also a price for beauty. i think i look good. when i walk around specially alone i usually get annoying comments mostly from girls who hangout together. usually the 1st girl poke her friend and &quot;secretly&quot; pointed at me. and the 2nd girl gonna say &quot;i disagree she&#39;s average looking&quot; or sometimes &quot;yeah she&#39;s pretty but she look dumb&quot; but they say it out loud by purpose so they make sure i hear it.

9259,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What is being hot is what makes one happy?,1
9260,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Aparncia no  tudo? Ah, v  merda. Queria ver se ela nascesse horrorosa, gorda e com cabelo zoado como o meu pra ver o quanto ela iria sofrer. No adianta ser inteligente. Pra algum feio ser aceito na sociedade,  preciso ter um tanto acima do normal. Fora isso, ser tratado sempre como um cidado de segunda linha. Quer um exemplo? Susan Boyle. A beleza abre portas sim: amizades, namoro e at mesmo EMPREGO. Quantas vagas j perdi por conta da aparncia? Com isso a autoestima da gente vai pro lixo. E ningum quer namorar os feios, no mximo pra amizade e se ele fizer um monte de favor ou for muito engraado. Negar isso  negar a realidade. Pelo menos no Brasil o negcio funciona assim.",1

9268,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,could of talked more about the injustice rather than her bland story,1
9269,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well its really easy for a beauty model to say looks arent everything. Its the same thing when rich people money isnt everything. The sad truth in both of these cases is it is and the only people saying otherwise are the pretty and wealthy ones. How about you go to a poor homeless woman or man in the streets, Im sure that they would strongly disagree with money isnt everything. Instead of telling people looks arent everything we should be saying love yourself for who you are and not what others want you to be.",1
9270,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The sad thing is looks actually are everything. As individual humans I wish it meant nothing but the sad thing is that society is and will always make it everything.,1

9282,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You assume that being pretty got you off with the cops. Maybe you were polite and admitted your mistake. Try being a little nasty and see what happens. Sure attractive people get lucky in life but nobody it is not because somebody made a criteria. It is natural. Nobody decided that we are going to make white people as standard of beauty, it just happened",1
9283,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You are biased. Ever wonder why white skin hispanics, not so dark Mexicans get frisked far ore than East Indians and Asians? Why Africans in US have far less problems with cops than African Americans?",1
9284,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I LOVE THIS TALK lol foreal,1
9285,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I can&#39;t believe that all the people here were surprising about what she said. It&#39;s so obvious things.,1
9286,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I clicked because she&#39;s a model... Citizen, that is! Model citizen",1
9287,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She almost got me crying here... Media should be much more about saying the truth than how it is now: manipulating everything to make it look &#39;better&#39;.<br>I&#39;m actually not insecure about myself and my body, but what made me so emotional right now is that I know SO many friends who are... and I always want to convince them to think positively about themselves/their body, but I never get the feeling that it actually works.",1
9288,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,so what do us uglies get out of life,1
9289,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love her courage for using her platform to bring to light one of the greatest issues in our society,1
9290,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This has such a great message,1
9291,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wish I could react &quot;love&quot; to this video.,1
9292,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I have been scouted to be a model. I was too young to be one but now that my birthday is coming up they&#39;re gonna contact me again. Honestly I don&#39;t know what to do...,1
9293,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Excellent video!,1
9294,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am by all means a very slow learner and in addition to that I am NOT a good looking person. Facts are facts and I am proven that everyday by how people treat me vs my beautiful coworkers. I mean it&#39;s sad and almost comical. I am nice, I am clean. Everyday in my room there I am in the morning making up myself to fit into society&#39;s standards and yet it doesnt cut it. So while I do agree people from all walks of life and impressive physical beauty have insecurities (I mean by the end of the day we are all humans) it is 100x worse for average and below average looking people. Step into my shoes. Now there are MANY talented folks out there, despite of their look, who are happy, confident, and just making it work. Kudos to them.",1
9295,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If you were uncomfortable doing that photo shot tell them so and quit. I was uncomfortable working at Target for their countless OSHA violations. Perhaps you&#39;d rather be a stick person at Target? Or a trash collector?,1
9296,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y, ????,1
9297,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nice video,1
9298,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,There&#39;s an episode of the Twilight Zone I&#39;d like you to see....,1
9299,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,My new favorite person.,1
9300,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Of course looks do not matter if you look like a model, your born with a belief that because of your looks, opportunities are handed to you, and eventually it becomes a part of every day life. This feeling of entitlement that exceptionally beautiful people especially women expect to be treated, is actually Very ugly. Date a model if you don&#39;t believe me. Its actually very sad to get to know a model you will get to see how insecure about themselves they really are, but its business as usual when pulled over for a ticket, or at traffic court, or paying bills in person, you can be assured they are &quot;working&quot; and they wont hide it and for some reason thats just part of life. HMMMM something is wrong with this world, and crying because your so pretty, is plain bulshit.",1
9301,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah, right...",1
9302,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i love her instantly i don&#39;t know why maybe her smile,1
9303,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fucking society.  I don&#39;t care what she says.  Miranda Kerr was married to Orlando Bloom and now married to a billionaire.  Do you think these men would have married an average &quot;joe blow&quot;. I think not.,1
9304,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its very depressing video for a handsome person,1
9305,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Legacy! What is a legacy? (Finish the lyric!),1
9306,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Money and beauty aren&#39;t everything. Believe me. I&#39;m not rich and not skinny. But happy...,1
9307,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are everything, unfortunately!!",1
9308,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything. Says a model. Lol.,1
9309,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just stop &#39;umm&#39;ing...,1
9310,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great talk because of the honesty,1
9311,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So if you&#39;re a black /Hispanic male you&#39;ll get pulled over and ticketed. If you&#39;re a white female you will be over sexualized/ exposed before even getting your period. What I&#39;m getting from this is that  society just dosent let anybody win (unless you&#39;re a white male),1
9312,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m a model and I approve of this message,1
9313,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"How come you often get uglyrich men with attarctive women but rarely ugly men with rich women? That suggest women far more influenced by money  and are far more superficial. Align that with the amount of money they spend on things like cosmetics they are shallower too.<br><br>In actuality some studies showed these to be true, indirectly. Cos of their need for security and family the study said, so they selfishy think of that future whereas men generally think of tomorrow on a good day. :D <br><br>Being attractive tho, whilst we know its kinda meaningless in reality, in absolutely powerful and advantageous.",1
9314,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news but beauty truly isn&#39;t a recipe for happiness. Some people have internalized society&#39;s garbage so deeply that they actually believe improving their &quot;shell&quot; will magically improve their life. So what if being pretty means getting &quot;free stuff&quot; and having certain advantages? Does being pretty guarantee that no one will ever bully you or hate you? Even if you recieve attention from guys/girls for said beauty, does it mean every romantic relationship you enter will be a success? That you&#39;ll never suffer a rejection or a breakup? Does being pretty mean that you&#39;ll never get sick? Does it mean you can&#39;t die? Does beauty transform you into a magical Pegasus bestowed with the gift of immortality? Does beauty mean that at your funeral, long after your youth has left, your obituary will be painted with beautiful words about your impact on society? If the answer to these questions is yes, by all means model your values around physical looks. If not, learn what inner work means so you can find your TRUE self. I&#39;m not saying these things to invalidate feelings of insecurity about being considered &quot;ugly&quot; by society. I&#39;m only asking you to reassess what really matters to you, and challenge society&#39;s recycled trash mantra about beauty being everything. Because if you don&#39;t, if you choose to internalize all the crap that media has shoved at you about how to look/dress, I guarantee you, not only will society continue to suffer as girls use beauty standards to punish each other, but you as an individual will never be happy. And that unhappiness will have nothing to do with your looks.<br><br>Rant over.",1
9315,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why did no one laugh at the beginning,1
9316,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,que charla mas estupida.,1

9319,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Dawg bro really,1
9320,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You can literally live of beauty, yeah, of just being beauty and nothing else. Like Candice Swanepoel, Behati Prinsloo, Adriana Lima and other VS models. I could say Miranda Kerr too but she founded her own organic cosmetic company (with the money she earn for being beauty). Even actress like Megan Fox or Scarlett Johansson who aren&#39;t skilled and if it wasn&#39;t for their looks nobody would care about they because they would be another average terrible actress (this also applies to actors like Zac Efron or Chris Evans). So yep. I wish I born pretty in my next life.",1
9321,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The &quot;genetics&quot; she attributes to her beauty is a Y chromosome. After evaluating her skeletal structure, it appears that she is a prepubescent male-to-female transgender. They have been portraying MTF transgenders as the ideal women for quite a while. Research transvestigation.",1
9322,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everyone is insecure. Just be you and everything else will fall in place,1
9323,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Says the model...stfu!!!.you know  nothing about being ugly,1
9324,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,There is a Ted ex talk in my university I am not sure where I should join it,1
9325,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s pretty much describing how being pretty is Fucking awesome. How your problems aren&#39;t normal and you get to worry about bullshit because you&#39;re pretty skinny and white and have nothing else to worry about. I know having a banging personality, wit &amp; intellect is major. It&#39;s what separates the average from the sexy but this is just regurgitating negative social constructs",1
9326,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Her speech is so inspirational but the reality is, those words still make us insecure of our looks... Bcs when people judge our appearance, we would start to worry.",1
9327,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Being beautiful is such a burden. I wouldn&#39;t wish it on anybody.,1
9328,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you&#39;ve ever wondered what self-indulgence would look like as a TED talk, well here it is.",1
9329,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is interesting how you can listen to a talk by some people fleeing North Korea and the brutality of this regime and people worrying about the way they look...,1
9330,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this talk should have been unattractive looking woman proving the point that looks don&#39;t  set how happy or sucessfull you are <br>Hearing &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything &quot; from a beautiful model it&#39;s the same as Hearing &quot;money isn&#39;t everything&quot; from millionaire<br>It isn&#39;t everything when you already got it,1
9331,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"OMG when she worn that normal clothes, an angel suddenly appeartent on my screen. I would told u that i love her with that look. Let image if i dont know she is a model, i could say that i love her, but in fact thats not happend. You can tell that to a normal girl and may be she like you, but when she was a model, if you say that, she would think that you love her bcs she is a model.",1

9345,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She graduated from Columbia with a double major in Economics and Poli Sci. She&#39;s hella smart.,1
9346,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Nothing about this talk inspired me. She&#39;s really genuine and likable but you don&#39;t get points for that. It felt more like a press conference and her describing her life which I did not care for. I was waiting for something to help my self-esteem but she was like: &quot;I wake up every day feeling insecure about my looks.&quot; Well, that&#39;s your problem sister! With everyone in the world telling you how beautiful you are, then you must be either really dense or deaf!",1

9355,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s right. People get away with things just because of there looks.,1
9356,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Insecure? Girl BYE. Quit trying to act as though ya life is so hard. It&#39;s people like ME who suffer good for you,you&#39;re pretty you get everything. You look good in your pictures and bomb in bikinis! Quit fucking around you probably just want followers from this. I don&#39;t believe 1 bit of whatever she said. Y&#39;all get PAID for looking PRETTY and for people like me oh no I can&#39;t do that because I&#39;m UGLY and INSECURE so quit bitching about your perfect fucking life",1
9357,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think it&#39;s so neat that she was humble enough as to &#39;come down to earth&#39; and admit that yes, being pretty helps, but it isn&#39;t everything.&#39; And that&#39;s so true. GOOD men (not ones who are conceited, self-absorbed, and absolutely honorless) will recognise true beauty, which is inside of a woman, not just outward. Even though most girls can make themselves beautiful, (yes, even quote &#39;ugly&#39; ones) with makeup, the right clothes, and/or surgery, you can&#39;t be truly beautiful without inward beauty, just like you can&#39;t be truly ugly with inward beauty. It&#39;s a very hard thing for girls (including myself) to find self-worth without outward beauty, though, so this is a great reminder that they (you!) don&#39;t need to be perfect! And if men won&#39;t respect women just because of their looks, then I say they are lost and don&#39;t deserve the woman, even if they&#39;re handsome and the woman isn&#39;t. Inward is waay more important than outward - we just forget it sometimes. So remember, don&#39;t judge someone by their looks - looks are fleeting, and will (naturally) fade with time (to an extent), but inward beauty can last forever.<br>And in case someone was going to say I said that to justify myself being ugly, I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;m not ugly - I&#39;m just not perfect. No one is. You cannot have the perfect looks for every person on Earth. Period. Exclamation mark.",1
9358,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s so sad to hear everyone saying they&#39;d rather be beautiful than happy. What kind of world do we live in?,1
9359,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Perceived successes aren&#39;t everything.,1

9368,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You guys are dumb. She&#39;s talking about white privilege and it&#39;s affects on people around her/society. The main area where she recognizes the privilege is in her modelling realm, hence why she stated that does model and focuses her prime examples/ based her talk to that",1
9369,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good looks with a good heart is everything.,1
9370,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The person that said looks don&#39;t matter is probably the same person that made up the sticks and stones crap. You can be qualified than your competition and they get chosen because they&#39;re pretty. So, looks shouldn&#39;t matter, but sadly they do.",1

People looked at me when ever I walked by, rocking my high heeled boots.<br>Yesterday evening I walked through the city, alone, and I cried.<br>I passed some homeless people, dirty hair and clothes, they sat in a circle, talking and laughing.

9376,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It is so weird when a model like her isn&#39;t arrogant nor self-centered. She knows that she won the genes. She tells the truth about photoshop.,1

Plus I don&#39;t think most of us guys want someone who is 70 lbs and has an eating disorder to look skinny like most fashion models these days.

9390,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything and neither is an education at Brown or Columbia. We have this extensive, yet truncated, line of direction in the Western world that denotes what constitutes an &quot;education&quot;. If people look back to the undergrads from the 60&#39;s and into the late 70&#39;s you&#39;d see a large collective of students who took to there philosophy and social course work, and attempted to change the world, to stop wars, to fight injustice. Well the establishment saw that threat and decided it would no longer teach students &quot;how to learn&quot;, but to &quot;memorize and obey&quot; Research the destruction the Tri-Lateral Commission did to education throughout the late 70&#39;s continuing to today. Post grad &quot;certificates&quot; are even worse as they make sure to fully indoctrinate the people into that truncated line. Veer anywhere from this line and you&#39;re castigated from  every angle. Its a sad state of an &quot;educated people&quot; when everywhere you look the &quot;good guys&quot; have left over 28,000,000 dead and counting in there wake of freedom. And not one protest against the ongoing injustice, the heads are wrongly stuck in thinking &quot;global warming&quot; is an issue caused by man, the hubris, pay attention to men in the shadows and the outstretched hands offering &quot;defense&quot; missiles to foreign(we) backed Nazis running the Kiev junta, for they are the ones counting on your continued obedience.",1

9410,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I understand that looks help you a lot, but that is what she is saying too. She is not opposing the point. This was a good talk. It was brave of her to admit all of this. ",1
9411,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People are obsessed with looks.,1
9412,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"every scientific research ever done on beauty screams one thing: BE BEAUTIFUL! beautiful people earn more money on average then the rest of us, they are generally more healthy, they tend to get better and higher paying jobs, they are more easilly forgiven when they do something wrong, they get better grades in school... even newborn babies smile more to beautiful people than to the rest of us!! and the list goes on and on. and it&#39;s not a matter of (just) me being frustrated, it&#39;s science. so basically all of this &quot;beauty isn&#39;t everything&quot; is BS. of course it isn&#39;t EVERYTHING, sherlock, but denying what we all know and what research validates is cynical and borderline offensive.",1
9413,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;The other half of the story is that we are insecure because we have to think about what we look like every day.&quot;<br>This line hit me hard.,1
9414,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for sharing dear ,1
9415,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This made me sad, because i&#39;m a little below average. I&#39;m a little chubbier than average. I&#39;m a little clumsier than the cute clumsy.<br>My whole body is a little wider than average. My face is a litte bit rounder than average. I&#39;m a little weirder than average.<br>I&#39;m a little uglier than average. <br>And Looks are really getting you somewhere. <br>I was sitting in a park with two other friends, when a group of boys came by and started talking to us. More to my friends, actually. They said stuff like &quot;You know who I just fucked..?&quot; &quot;Look, I have condoms&quot; Like, a lot of sexually things. <br>Then the started talking about us. Rating us. &quot;Yo, the blond girl, she is the prettiest!&quot; &quot;Yeah, and this brunette is like number two&quot;<br>&quot;Oh and than there&#39;s that girl with the backpack&quot; THAT GIRL was me. I&#39;m always THAT GIRL.<br>That girl who dropped her lunch in the cafeteria. That girl who constantly loses her purse.<br>That girl who has strange friends.<br>That girl who draws constantly.<br>That girl with long flowy skirts no one wears anymore.<br>That weird girl.<br>And I know I shouldn&#39;t let these words define me, but they do. I just want to be called pretty, I want to not get laughed and stared at, I want to be one of the popular girls, I want a easy life.",1
9416,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"From the previous comments that i read, people say that its easy saying so coming from such a thin white and beautiful person. See that&#39;s the point, it is not. Its not easy standing up against what you&#39;ve grown with, what you have and be brutally honest when you are putting so many people you have worked with at risk. Instead of putting up an argument about how its so easy for her, lets focus at what a commendable job she has done educating young girls how looks are not everything while that&#39;s what got her where she is and balancing honesty with a heck ton of learning.",1
9417,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Could you make this more politically charged? I can just imagine how uncomfortable the people in that room were.,1
9418,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,LIARRRRR,1
9419,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looking at some of the comments on here I would like to add something. Coming from an attractive women I have been targeted by endless perverts who looked like they would RAPE me just to do something with an attractive girl. This lady is right my life was ruined,1
9420,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Love her honesty. Winning the genetic lottery is a different definition from person to person. My husband would say she is pretty but shaped like a 12 year old boy. He thinks the genetic lottery is looking more like Christina Hendricks. So yes in the modeling world she won the genetic lottery but in the real world? Not always. ,1
9421,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s right that some comments miss the point of the talk, which seems to be &quot;Good looks aren&#39;t the key to happiness&quot; and that is true, but while it&#39;s not the key, it&#39;s pretty hard for most of us to become happy without it. Someone here compared it to being rich, which also isn&#39;t the key to happiness but it can make it easier - It&#39;s upon the person to use it correctly.<br>And that&#39;s the crux in this whole discussion here: What does correctly mean, or: What does happiness mean for her/for us?<br>If being happy for her just meant finding the right guy and living a stable life, I&#39;d say that would be no problem for her - Whether she&#39;s insecure or not.<br>For some of us happiness just means to be accepted in the society. She can&#39;t consider those thoughts, because she never faced them.<br><br>So she is right about her talk and everyone has his/her own problems and insecurities but there are different levels and that&#39;s why some people here are disappointed etc by the talk.",1
9422,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,As a person who is diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder this video actually helped my view over my looks.,1
9423,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is like the speech a socialist would give about stopping evictions but lives in a big mansion lol,1
9424,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Moral of the story: When your white all things are in your favor.,1
9425,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"After hearing her talk title should be from aren&#39;t to are .She definitely won the genetic lottery, is lucky and to be born beautiful. ",1
9426,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lol being a model isn&#39;t always about being the prettiest .  alot of models aren&#39;t even that attractive in my opinion an  in reality looks will only get you so far. ... people don&#39;t automatically always like you or  treat you good  just because you look good... there will always be people trying to bring you down in life no matter your circumstances,1
9427,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wouldn&#39;t it be amazing if they had prince EA on Ted talk,1
9428,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Winning the genetic lottery does seem unfair and it is but we don&#39;t yet have the technology and will to do something about it, as in designed people. When we will and everyone will look amazing there will still be models because somebody still has to be shown wearing or using the products that will be advertised. Moral of the story, good looking people get attention and people want to listen even if they don&#39;t have much information to convey, like this TED talk.",1
9429,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She laughs at her jokes, awkwardly waaay to much.",1
9430,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks aren&#39;t everything shouldn&#39;t be the title of this video cos it&#39;s click bait,1
9431,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A truly genuine and inspiring talk.,1
9432,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Such a sad comment section...you guys don&#39;t realize beauty has to do with the way you look at yourself and what you think you are worth of. Being ugly is not a sin, and being pretty will not cure you. You can be &#39;ugly&#39; and have confidence and be loved, and you can be pretty and be totally insecure and have fake lovers. Choose what you want...",1
9433,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Easy to say when you have good looks.,1
9434,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ttulo em Portugus, mas no tem legenda LOL",1
9435,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Clearly looks aren&#39;t everything, because my first boyfriend was an ugly bloke.",1
9436,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fucking liar.,1
9437,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23emotion"">#emotion</a> ",1
9438,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
9439,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s easy to say looks don&#39;t matter when you&#39;re conventionally pretty &amp; skinny. Still love the message tho, just wish that society in general understood.",1
9440,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think I&#39;ll add on to what I know on beauty,1
9441,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In todays age there are barely any females without make up.<br>Lets analyze the word shortly:<br>Make Up. So this implies its something you put over your face, you make it up.<br>So a good looking girl is mostly skinny (can be trained, made with fitness) and lots of make up, which is also unnatural to begin with. <br>People that think of themself as beautiful, will spend a great deal in mantaining that image and are in constant need to be admired in some kind of fashion.(obvious and non obvious)<br>People that think that looks are important suffer in reality, because their emotions and feelings are connected to the idea what others think of you.And with age it gets even more terrible, because oh look, your body is aging and dying, how terrible.<br>Well, i hope you can see that looking pretty isnt important at all. If you think you need to look pretty to get the man or woman you always wanted to finally get kids and be happy, you are delusional anyway. Cheers.",1
9442,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s beautiful tho ,1
9443,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Apparently looks don&#39;t make you funny.,1
9444,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Grat speech,1
9445,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great mind...,1
9446,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its always models who say looks dont matter,1
9447,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Rich- money is nothing<br>beautiful- look is nothing,1
9448,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, she said so much truth in such a short speach!",1
9449,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks is everything no matter people say it , we love beautiful staff unfortunately humans nature ",1
9450,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Preach,1
9451,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beauty helps most of things. She isn&#39;t totally right. Just not be a model! Then, she doesn&#39;t need to worry about looks as much as she does as a model!!",1
9452,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Okay, I have watched a few Ted talks. But I have a huge question. When will Ted show up?",1
9453,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why did you have to bring race in it??? Dislike,1
9454,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t like the title. Her being a model gives her no more insight into inner/outer beauty than anyone else. The fashion industries definition of beauty is not a universal definition.,1
9455,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"My name is Russell and my best friend&#39;s name is Cameron. Neither of us look very good, and we&#39;re nerds. Believe everything you hear in this video.",1
9456,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,When looks aren&#39;t everything money is,1
9457,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Even if you won the genetic lottery the life of a model is short and fleeting . Got to have something to back it up eventually .,1
9458,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You ever notice that its the people who have things, that say it doesn&#39;t matter. Like she&#39;s a pretty model and saying looks don&#39;t matter. Just like how rich people say money doesn&#39;t buy happiness. Its easy to say those things when you have them.",1
9459,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,In school looks matter<br>in college looks + intelligence+ playing guitar<br>in job less looks +more money+car+home<br><br>so yeah looks are not everything.,1
9460,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,SUMMARY:<br><br>Looks aren&#39;t everything (but it damn-well helps to be pretty).,1
9461,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To be so smart, you seem incredibly stupid.",1
9462,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,10 mins of white guilt,1
9463,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When I got past the nervous laughter I concluded having profited by the system you want to profited by highlighting the consequence of exploitation. When was last time you walked into poor or black or normal people as proof of your honesty. We have not defined beauty, the establishment social engineered the masses into consumers instead of citizen of the world. They had family, but their partners did not and could not fulfill their fantasies so they paid to live their dream. Once they did, they realized it was a momentary dream. Out of reach, impossible to fulfill expectation, so to overcome their frustration of unfulfilled fantasy they social engineered and imposed it on their ignorant subjects to control and profit from them. Today as it has been for many centuries most are insecure frustrated unfulfilled consumers, because they taken leave of their senses. They remove natural oil of body evolved over millions of years by detergent and then replace it with artificially created rubbish because it sell as age barrier. Then they sell another grease to titan your skin. The stupid consumer forgot that they told them to stretch the skin by massage it in, in first place. Non is as stupid as those who do not use their own rational and like to remain stupid. MG1",1
9464,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel like you can see her whisper of a moustache from this angle and it only underlines her statement because she is amazingly pretty nonetheless.,1
9465,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Here..take this dislike, likes aren&#39;t everything",1
9466,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s smart.i thot she wud hv been dumb,1
9467,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Please tell me I&#39;m not the only one who thought of Hamilton when she said &quot;what is a legacy?&quot;,1
9468,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love her audacity to speak up and show her real beauty, away from how people perceive her or models in general should look like. There are definitely models out there who look almost the same as they are in print (Joan Smalls is a good example), but most of these girls don&#39;t look like themselves in the magazines. Knowing that you ain&#39;t the same person as the girl in print is one thing, but showing the world and being proud of it is another. I like her attitude about it.",1
9469,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The driver is money, not race.",1
9470,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m not a model also I agree with her every one who see me complement my look and think I have a beautiful body and face alot of strangers come to me and say are you a model but guess what the most they ask me about this the most insecure I become because I fear to lose it I fear that I ruin my image in their eyes I know I&#39;m not perfect and they see me so perfect in look I don&#39;t know if they notice my personality that so hard she&#39;s right looks isn&#39;t everything but it will give you a help to get what you want anyway it won&#39;t make you happy,1
9471,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m not a model also I agree with her every one who see me complement my look and think I have a beautiful body and face alot of strangers come to me and say are you a model but guess what the most they ask me about this the most insecure I become because I fear to lose it I fear that I ruin my image in their eyes I know I&#39;m not perfect and they see me so perfect in look I don&#39;t know if they notice my personality that so hard you&#39;re right looks isn&#39;t everything but it will give you a great help to get what you want easily,1
9472,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,come on.......being a model is awesome<br>yesterday I get my first photoset for a product,1
9473,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet,1
9474,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I dont know how to feel abt her message. Im confused. Should i be happy for her becsuse she was &quot;brave&quot;? Or... Is she trying to downplay her gifts by trying to appear ordinary?<br><br>Boohoo-im-too-beautiful- pity-me line. Image-is-manufsctured argument. Yes, we KNOW THAT. That doesnt take a genius.<br><br>BUT INSTEAD OF celebrating her uniqueness, she chooses to berate her beauty and downplay her gifts. It is as if she is telling everyone &quot;beauty is evil so beware.Try to be ugly and dress like crap&quot;.<br><br>Instesd of whinmng abt your gifts, be grateful.",1
9475,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She has a beautiful mind!,1
9476,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is like a billionare telling a starving man that money can&#39;t buy happiness.,1
9477,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,your voice and style is like Katrina Kaif.,1
9478,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why does this topic has to do with race i don&#39;t get it,1
9479,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I did ok in the genetic lottery. I&#39;m not hot, but I&#39;m not ugly either. So I don&#39;t relate to hot people or ugly people because I am neither.",1
9480,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,her message was excellent and she also talks too fast cause Shes probably useto being talked over maybe.... pretty faces are ignored as soon as they speak.,1
9481,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is a special woman !,1
9482,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s easy to talk when you already experienced all of that.,1
9483,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,fake is everywhere. do not compare their outside with your inside.,1
9484,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why are you stating the obvious,1
9485,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Media is the one to blame,1
9486,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Amazing Insight to be appreciated.<br>Especially when it comes from such a person.,1
9487,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is one the level of a millionaire complaining &quot;yes, I&#39;ve got privilege and money, but I just feel insecure because of it&quot;. As if losing all that money will make you more secure.",1
9488,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,My bestfriend always says I&#39;m fat and ugly. He makes fun of my acne and how I&#39;m not as skinny as him. But then he says he&#39;s fat. He makes me feel horrible and I just laugh with him. I know he&#39;s joking but jokes really do hurt. I was eating less and less everyday but then when school got out my mom made me eat. I want to stop eating completely. I just want to be skinny.,1
9489,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,amazing speech,1
9490,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m super sure that if the model that went up there was karlie kloss o gigi hadid everyone would be clapping and saying that she ir a role model. She&#39;s got the guts to speak her mind and i respect her for that. She is a super talented model and a great speaker.,1
9491,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,okay this girl is pretty or cute but she isnt that good looking I see better looking girls in college classroom I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder,1
9492,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,god,1
9493,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But why male models?,1
9494,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Can I be a model in Africa when I&#39;m not white? How about in Asia ? Ya your stat is useless and irrelevant. I&#39;m sorry , non white ppl are listening to your ted talk .",1
9495,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is an old video BUT after I went through puberty and lost any extra weight I was carrying, I got treated COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! Before I became &quot;pretty &quot; I was treated just basic, kinda rudely, by people. Now, I get traded a lot better, guys help me at the drop of a pen, it may sound harsh, but that&#39;s the truth (in my personal experience) I&#39;m just saying, skinny pretty woman get treated a lot better.",1
9496,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,superficial vain commentary everywhere below,1
9497,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yep, looks don&#39;t matter. It&#39;s your personality and confidence.

9499,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ok I get it the outside dosent mean the inside there,1
9500,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m here to see the comments ,1
9501,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wpi,1
9502,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron has always been one of my favorite models ever, and now with this, she is one of my favorite persons.",1
9503,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
9504,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There are not many black models simply because all of the big fashion hauls think that black women can be represented by 2 ,3 models in contrast with white women that are represented by tones of different model. THATS WHY THERE ARE NOT MANY BLACK MODELS.",1
9505,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The only time she looked up was when she said &#39;I&#39;m insecure&#39;.,1
9506,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well, looks are one of the factors that compels someone to mate with you, and scientifically speaking reproduction is the entire meaning of life. So they kind of sort of are",1
9507,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thank you!,1
9508,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"well , looks is really matter if u unattractive. before i was fat ,acnes not nice teeth and unfashional. no one even noticed and want to be with me. u can say bcuz of my personality   blabla... but if u unattractive, even talk they dont want how they can underatand how amazing u are?? after 3 years, now i think i am ok with my look. and my life changed a lot. looks is really matter and people usually judge on it!!",1
9509,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,k byt im sad becayse people make fun of me for being ugly,1
9510,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s acknowledging and exposing her privilege and that actually means a lot,1
9511,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Being attractive really isn&#39;t all that great said the hot person.<br>Being rich isn&#39;t all that great said the rich person.<br>Being physically fit and healthy isn&#39;t all that great said the athlete.<br>Being tremendously lucky isn&#39;t all that great said the lottery winner.<br>Those things are all  absolutely wonderful said the person with even an ounce of perspective.,1
9512,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why are people so convinced that she&#39;s wrong? She&#39;s one of the most privileged people in the world, you can&#39;t say &quot;you should be happy you have it all meanwhile I have nothing&quot; is ridiculous, you can&#39;t possibly expect her to ignorantly forget of the world around her and simply enjoy herself. She&#39;s saying it&#39;s not easy, she&#39;s not asking for pity, she&#39;s trying to spread the word that this isn&#39;t the ideal as one might think it is.",1
9513,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is great for girls who feel like makeup or hair styles are necessary to make them pretty, because that really isn&#39;t true. But if you&#39;re a boy and hate what you look like, you&#39;re out of luck. There&#39;s no makeup to fix atrociously high metabolisms or an easy way to change facial features. Where do I get a talk on dealing with what you actually look like instead of what you want to be?",1
9514,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,parece bien,1
9515,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lovely speech,1
9516,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m a male model and she is completely correct .,1
9517,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great young lady!!!,1
9518,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Best TEDX talk ive ever seen.,1
9519,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you know the reason for certain races or genders not being a high number in a certain job is they don&#39;t want to do it. not racism.,1
9520,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What a ridiculously condescending talk. She&#39;s the recipient of all the perks and rewards that go along with her modelling career, yet her message to the world is that she is insecure and that the images dished out by the modelling world are well-crafted illusions which make young people hate their bodies, while privileging her racial position. Okay, well, if all that bothers her so much, why continue to collect a paycheck from the very industry whose destructive features she&#39;s so articulately presented? Apparently, money decides her ethics. A familiar tale indeed. :)",1
9521,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,true stuffs tt may be weird,1
9522,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Money isn&#39;t everything. Trust me, I am a billionaire.&quot;<br>                               - Bill Gates",1
9523,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think most people don&#39;t realize that the only reason you care about your own looks is if you don&#39;t have anything else to offer. Why would you want to be used as something that&#39;s fun to look at,1
9524,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow,1
9525,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"dafaq this thumbnail is itself touched and edited. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fakeFakeWorld"">#fakeFakeWorld</a>",1
9526,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for bring truthful and for  being kind. God bless,1
9527,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks don&#39;t always make you happy it just makes life convenient coz I can find happiness from not being good looking but I do experience the inconvenience.,1
9528,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To look at this purely on its own merit is to miss the point. What she is explaining is the fundamentals that apply to all things we see as valuable in a capitalist society, and is caused by an unhealthy desire for more - to be better looking, richer, more popular, etc etc. The only path to true happiness is accepting who you are  - warts and all. Only then can you fully embrace all that life has to offer.",1
9529,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A model saying looks aren&#39;t everything is like rich saying money isn&#39;t everything. It would be more convincing if ugly says looks aren&#39;t everything,1
9530,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"blah blah blah blah.... how self absorbed... I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m white and attractive,  forgive me... I&#39;ve made lots of money and I&#39;m unhappy and feel a need to shed some of this guilt about it,  before I jump on the Emerites first class flight  to Madrid to spend a week on the beach..... if I was really sorry for my career I&#39;d give it up and go work at dairy queen,  but... let&#39;s be real naaaa that&#39;s not going to happen,  anyone want to go to the club tonight,  I&#39;ll get us In free !!!",1
9531,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She made many informative statements in this video... but I haven&#39;t been able to dig out the purpose... can someone help me out here?<br>I think what she&#39;s saying is that the current standard of beauty is unrealistic and largely fake, but that begs the question of why she still models? Because from what I understand, her modeling career is only helping the industry to grow... ",1
9532,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ya u right looks aren&#39;t everything....,1
9533,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,if you are pretty and tall trust me may not be everything but it does help get you through life. and life is a whole lot easier believe me.,1
9534,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s woke. This talk really impacted me, as a young black woman growing up in American society and culture.",1
9535,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i love ya,1
9536,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,watched the video<br>learned a lesson<br>watching a marathon of antm ,1
9537,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,if you think you are nothing but an ugly face than no one would bother to believe the opposite...,1
9538,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are over reacting. LOL!,1
9539,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what a gorgeous and intelligent and GIVING SOUL,1
9540,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She sounds like she&#39;s really struggling to breath. Is she okay?,1
9541,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The artificial touching up has really fucked with my perception of beauty. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a permanent effect, but it&#39;s certainly an effect on my brain. I have a hard time when it comes to considerations for a mate because of my perceptions about beauty. It&#39;s like I want my partner to be beautiful so that I can impress people. But then I have these unrealistic perceptions about what beautiful is, too. It&#39;s made it extra difficult for me to just approach any average woman who seems interesting because so many of them aren&#39;t quite &quot;beautiful enough.&quot; It&#39;s like I know what I want, but what I want isn&#39;t real.",1
9542,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Still women judge me by my ugliness,1
9543,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"They tend to laugh with her sayings even when she&#39;s not funny just because she is beautiful. <br>She although admits her reason of success. That&#39;s brave at least. She can&#39;t help it though.<br>Oh and it&#39;s not a lottery, she just had beautiful parents that hooked together.",1
9544,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Who ever said looks are everything?,1
9545,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not all great-looking people are models, but all models are great-looking.",1
9546,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beauty means different things to different people. It&#39;s subjective, or as they say, in the eyes of the beholder. To some people beauty is a certain type of figure, and a symmetrical face painted with makeup, to the point where they look more like a doll than a human being. To me beauty is in the soul and expression thereof. Beauty is being brave enough to be yourself, and to look deep inside to figure out who yourself really is. Beauty is an open mind. Beauty is the ability to resolve conflict without taking to violence. Beauty is intelligence. So what I&#39;m saying is, to me it&#39;s not about looks. Even so I have some idea of what I think looks beautiful too. Or rather just what I prefer to look at. Because that is what it is, a preference. True beauty, I believe, goes beyond human comprehension, and beyond the preferences of the ego.",1
9547,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,its so TRUE!!!!! Looks are<br>not everything!! my<br>brother is dating a 21<br>year old..beautiful girl..<br>&amp; she is LAZY..DON&#39;T have a JOB &amp; Uses my <br>Brother&#39;s money$$$$$$<br>to go shopping...<br>medicure/pedicure and<br>among other fun things<br>she does with his money$$<br>its ridiculous&amp;the worst<br>part of it all is..they have a<br>6 months old baby girl..&amp;<br>my MOM babysitt their<br>daughter..my brother works.<br>....but all she does is SLEEP.<br>or out DOING STUFF.....<br>SHOPPING....ETC.....&amp; my<br>brother lets her do anything<br>she wants..she ALWAYS<br>NEGLECTS her baby..its<br>so sad,1
9548,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything but they are matter in both males and females. When you are walking at downtown or taking the train, you probably judge people based on how their body and faces are. This is how human mind works. Even 2 month old babies can tell if a face is attractive or not.",1
9549,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she is right!! all the people who say that &#39;it&#39;s easy for beautiful people to say looks don&#39;t matter&#39; are the ones who comprise the pool of people who discriminate our physical diversity! and that makes up a huge portion of our population. What she means by legacy is just so right!!! it&#39;s all these standards which are created by us people over a long time, those (wrong)thoughts are so deep sowed in our minds, that we can&#39;t see the depth of person, we just look at them superficially and judge them bcz of that!!<br><br><br>Also, I&#39;m not a good looking person, And I still like my looks!!",1
9550,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I used to be ugly... Still am, but I used to be too",1
9551,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"As much as i liked her speech, I strongly disagree with her. Looks ARE extremely important.",1
9552,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks arent everything huh?Explain to me how you got your job?,1
9553,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,breathing simulator,1
9554,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wait, you mean the modelling industry is shallow and disingenuous?MIND BLOWN",1
9555,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I live in a town where woman who look good knows they can get away with stealing from a store. they don&#39;t fit the part of a drug addict or criminal. and they will use two sketchy guys as decoys while she gets away. doesn&#39;t relate to this much, but we do judge people by looks",1
9556,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,WOW,1
9557,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks don&#39;t matter. Money.,1
9558,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You did not have to cover your legs ... you were fine in short skirts (and i dress long).. .noone has to make any lude remarks just because you wear shorts or show your &quot;dcollet&quot;...... so if you feel you have to dress just because some people want us to be all covered ... then too bad for you ... and it is very telling on where the safety of women, freedom and democracy s tand in the Western world at the momen ....",1
9559,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It is complicated and easy for good looking people to say that looks don&#39;t matter, you just see one side of the story",1
9560,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,oh my she is wonderful. I didnt know models had brains!,1
9561,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks and money are everything in life,1
9562,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think we as people should fight lookism, or having a bias towards someone that looks better. Sure, it may be ingrained in our biology to do so, but you must remember that we&#39;ve basically annihilated things like racism and sexism (at least in the Western world). We will always be more lenient towards people of the same race or gender, but we make an effort to remain completely impartial. Regarding looks, it should be the same, as how you look is literally as uncontrollable as your race or gender. I wish we could congratulate people on factors they CAN manipulate, like work ethic, etc.",1
9563,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,beauty is skin deep but its appreciation comes from deep within.,1
9564,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lets all appreciate the courage it took and the honesty to potray the insecurities large brands take advantage of..,1
9565,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The real problem here is whether people can understand the talk, if they don&#39;t, is just a bunch of words, but if they do, they get to take away something from them.",1
9566,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is still very pretty without any of the makeup and touch ups, really sweet personality too",1
9567,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The world is a shallow place so...,1
9568,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its so cringey,1
9569,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why is she fucking changing on stage ????,1
9570,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,yeah she won the lottery cause she is smart too,1
9571,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oh what bullshit. Let&#39;s be realistic and NOT idealistic, looks get you in front in this world, and she&#39;s proof. So don&#39;t believe her sob story.",1

9574,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Amazing,1
9575,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everyone here says &quot;life is easier with good looks&quot;. Yes. Go tell it to all the pervs and jealous people they have to face everyday.,1

9577,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"you have beauty face girl, its different",1
9578,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Jeez... I watched till the end and the title is the wrongest thing in this video. Just watch the last 40 sec and you&#39;ll see what she meant.,1
9579,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What is considered good looking is a notion developed when your kind has had power and wealth for a certain number of generations.<br>Power is everything.<br>There isn&#39;t anything very attractive about being skinny and colourless(white).<br>Faults of our mediocre society.,1
9580,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow! I feel so bad for her. It&#39;s so terrible. I hope she recovers from this tragedy.,1

9583,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oh, we believe you.  First, you&#39;re not that good looking.  You probably slept with anyone and anything to get your picture taken.  Second, you are a complete idiot.  You think you are funny and clever, but you are among the most ridiculously poor orators I have ever heard.  But so nice of you to make this self-serving egocentric narcissistic video for the rest of us, who you clearly believe are all inferior to you in every way.  And funny, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re sitting back thinking  you have made yourself look better in our eyes, but like everything else in your life, you are wrong, because of your worthless &quot;brain&quot;.  Those of us with an actual brain however need to thank you, as we do not get to laugh this hard often.  So please make another video for us demonstrating your cluelessness as you try to prove yourself superior again but only end up revealing yourself as an empty vacuous pathetically desperate loser seeking attention from the few of us you can convince are actually beneath you so you may delude yourself into believing you are worth nothing and always will be.  Again, thank you for the laughter, you pathetic loser",1

9616,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I was jus watching a video about this girl who ppl viewed as ugly but in my opinion I thought she was pretty and I also thought of all the other girls who go everyday thinking about how pretty they look. This model really has changed my view on things even though I&#39;ve never been the one to say ur pretty but I have been insecure and it&#39;s good for someone to remind me that everyone is insecure but what made them insecure was society&#39;s cruel way of thinking.,1
9617,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Her talk was so impactful :&quot;),1
9618,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y, Wondered  what is saying this beatiful girl :),1
9619,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,All good n beautifull<br><br>,1
9620,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I personally find people more attractive (or less) the more I discover their personality. People I find attractive are not usually the  standardized definition of beauty. On another note, I think most people first judge you depending on how you look. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve been single the 19 years of my life bc I&#39;m not pretty.",1
9621,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I also won the &#39;genetic lottery&#39; and worked as a model for a number of years. They say that beauty can also be a curse and for me it has proven so in many ways. One of the biggest problems is that many people will instantly like you just because you&#39;re attractive. It&#39;s almost like an auto acceptance however you&#39;re not being accepted for your personality, just the way you look. I have had many problems in relationships where people have dated me because I was attractive when in reality I was never their true &#39;type&#39;. Shallow relationships where people were to have me on their arm as an accessory without connecting to the essence of who I was. This may sound petulant but when you encounter it all your life it can be a real negative.",1

9660,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So she&#39;s come out and said &quot;looks don&#39;t matter!&quot; and everyone has commented to say &quot;yes but they do, and I hate that they do!&quot; Well you&#39;re part of the problem as well then. Stop saying that they do. Stop thinking that they do. That&#39;s what we all want right? Well everyone has to start believing and saying that then. That they don&#39;t. Stop making it matter yourself as well. obviously I get thst most of society believes looks matter, but if only even a few of us change our minds it&#39;s better than none, rather than just falling in line with that thinking because everybody else does even though we hate it and it&#39;s not really us. looks don&#39;t matter. let&#39;s start saying that instead.",1
9661,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love the wild life. I hate humanity.(: fucking humans ):{ why cantthey just die. I&#39;m alien.,1
9662,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Didnt think americans were this conservative , like the cloth covering was something I never thought would be considered inappropriate in america....so in american tv everything related to women have 70% bikini and revealing stuff so there getting offended and disgusted everytime they watch tv? Surprising how the industry enterprises and sells the very thing that the population hates.. SO they do think its inappropriate......and yet merchandises it?",1
9663,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Am I the only person who wouldn&#39;t have even taken notice had she started out in either outfit? Society is weird.,1
9664,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Money isn&#39;t everything, it doesn&#39;t make you happy.&quot; Said millionaire to a homeless guy.",1
9665,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m sure it makes models insecure to be models,1
9666,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Interesting point of view,1
9667,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Huge respect for you. It would take huge loads of guts to be able to say these words in front of the world.,1
9668,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,beauty is important for marriage. thats why woman do diet and plastic surgery in korea. cus ugly girls hard to get marrige in korea,1
9669,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Gross,1
9670,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Always beautiful people tell others how look doesnt matter.,1
9671,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Money is not everything. Trust me, I am a millionaire.",1
9672,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If white skin is so desirable...  why the fake tan?,1
9673,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"basically, she wants to impart that sexy are not particular on just being beautiful, but sexy can be someone smart, and insecure too. She&#39;s telling us that we can be anyone no matter what we are. She&#39;s imparting to us that beauty may have its perks but its difficult too.",1
9674,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She killed the Intro!! Love her heart!,1
9675,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Powerful ,1

9677,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks are very important if you want to get ahead!,1
9678,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yeah sure buddy. i rather be good looking and happy or not, over being ugly and definitely not being happy. on the other side i would prefer to be smart over being good looking.",1
9679,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a lovely woman ,1
9680,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the subconscious mind, looks matters a lot",1
9681,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Models are some of the kindest women on the planet theres a few of them that need help, but none that I&#39;ve met that totally turned on me like some fat goth girl did to me back in the day. Thats why they are models, people love them, because they love themselves. Its not her fault she likes to be healthy and wear nice clothes. Some people really need to look at themselves instead of judging others.",1
9682,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks really don&#39;t matter! I&#39;ve known plenty of people who were considered &quot;not so attractive&quot; but were so happy in their lives and within themselves and really breathtakingly gorgeous people who are depressed. Life is what you make of it ^^,1
9683,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ok but it&#39;s still better to be sad at a Hollywood party with lots of cocaine and beautiful rich people than sad in a studio apartment with only boxed wine and no company,1
9684,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,so brave of her to give a personal speech! cute jokes too.,1
9685,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She clearly has a conscience and is grateful for her blessings. I think that gives her an inner beauty too.,1
9686,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,When you lose IQ by reading the comments of people arguing the exact fucking point she was giving the entire video.,1
9687,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything when you don&#39;t have to worry about them, same as money. No one, given the opportunity, would choose to be ugly over being attractive, same as no one would choose being poor over being rich. So it&#39;s obvious those two qualities have some intrinsic value, while not being the be all and end all (but that&#39;s fucking obvious?). I actually find this video a little insulting.",1
9688,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what hits home. ..... is true chemistry!!!!!!! Physical beauty is or it might be only temporary stimulating if it isn&#39;t true or real.,1
9689,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You look ravening !!!!!! Beautiful!!!!!!!! Gorgeous!!!!!!! Naturally amazing! !!!!!!!! Just, Wow !!!!!!!! However, classiness  and elegance, which some do not posses unlike you is not only an art but, also a true essence!",1
9690,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron, you have presented a dichotomy!? &quot;Beauty, is in the eye of the be hold.&quot; it&#39;s hard to see beyond the physical! ? I&#39;ve tried to go out with different men and it&#39;s not been a success. Moreover, physically attractive or not doesn&#39;t warranty a good, worthy, honest man nor woman partner in your life.",1
9691,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"ohhhh that&#39;s horrible when people think your perfect.  We are all imperfect, but we are all unique and attractive in our own ways. Thank you.",1
9692,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron,  everyone wants to be a model right now. we can&#39;t all be as beautiful as you are right now.",1
9693,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i lost on YouTube,1
9694,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I am beautiful and I have the worst life. I don&#39;t have many friends. I don&#39;t have success in life. I&#39;m isolated. I was bullied. I&#39;m insecure. I don&#39;t feel good enough. Looks aren&#39;t everything,1
9695,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Couldn&#39;t finish the video.  Stopped at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=6m25s"">6:25</a>.  I know this video was old <br>so nobody will read what I write. But hey, I make almost $300k a year <br>doing programming, and I have QA in the team, BA, tech manager, sales <br>... etc. So what!  Can I say those are my team and its not me?!?!?!  <br>They shot you because you&#39;re what you are.  I won&#39;t brag about it and I <br>don&#39;t see that you&#39;re humbled. Watching this isn&#39;t inspiring at all.  <br>Just stay low key to earn your money by jumping back and forth. Good luck. No take away at all.",1
9696,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she isn&#39;t even that beautiful lollll :Ddd she looks like a transvestite with those eyebrows XD,1
9697,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she isn&#39;t even that beautiful lollll :Ddd she looks like a transvestite with that eyebrows XD,1
9698,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The reason why looks &#39;matter&#39; in a scientific sense is because all of our brains are wired up to recognise facial features so we can differentiate between who we, know, like, don&#39;t like, recognise etc, etc, media companies use these instincts to manipulate and manufacture how we respond to certain stimuli and implant ideas of popular culture.  Go easy on yourselves and stop watching  adverts.",1
9699,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This the best thing I have ever heard &amp; ever girl should hear.,1
9700,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Guys, listen to the talk. Her message is that the models draw their confidence from looks, because this is only thing they are valued by other people, and that makes them miserable, insecure and pretty much empty.",1
9701,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;there are people paying a cost for how they look, not who they are.&quot; Wow, this really hit home for me. The right side of my face and my teeth are very disfigured and....yeah.....I have been so judged my whole life for how I look. Tossed aside, made to feel inferior, etc. I dream of a life I could never have because the way I look will never allow it.",1
9702,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It is everything,1
9703,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but she is pretty. she can&#39;t understands anything. she just mocking ugly people.,1
9704,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yeah, if i was good looking i wont had a mental breakdown ffs",1
9705,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love the caption of this video because it makes it very easy to tell which commenters didn&#39;t actually watch the video.,1
9706,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I like the 2nd outfit better lol,1
9707,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she looks like a cameron as well,1
9708,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Kylie  jenner should open her eyes wide and watch this,1
9709,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Models always look so manly lol,1
9710,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah.. Because you have it...,1
9711,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,its interesting as well how the good looking women get all the protection from the wankers.,1
9712,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,rip TED you are no longer a source of knowledge! I dont care what these stupid people has to say!,1
9713,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Most honest confession of any model i have heard so far..kudos to you.,1
9714,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"On point talk. Respect for recognizing your privilege,and stating the other side.",1
9715,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she points out to the problem of the profession of the model, not the problem of being pretty vs being mediocre",1
9716,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,shes not even cute,1
9717,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,tedx has better insight than this.,1
9718,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok say this out loud slowly, &quot;I would not be speaking at this forum if it weren&#39;t for my looks&#39;.         It&#39;s ok ... I&#39;ll wait ....",1
9719,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,DEEEEP,1
9720,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t like the title, it&#39;s misleading as her actual talk is giving a different message.",1
9721,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This woman graduated from Columbia University with majors in Economics and Political science, she IS fucking more than just her looks. Just like any other woman.",1
9722,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The people hating on this video are probably people who are uncomfortable or are unaware that they are privileged like Cameron Russell is .,1
9723,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she looks like Ashley Graham,1
9724,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everyone wants to jump on a cause,1
9725,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Literally the realest model in the entire industry.,1
9726,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thanks good for all,1
9727,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she is a hero for everything she confessed..,1
9728,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Boohoo lets all cry for the pretty white girl who&#39;s insecure,1
9729,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,They are stop denying,1
9730,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Okay but why does she breathe so heavily,1
9731,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great lady who seems to be down to earth but easy to say when you are beautiful. And yes, beauty opens a lot of doors",1
9732,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,being pretty has advantage..,1
9733,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wouldn&#39;t her unhappiness stem from her career instead of her looks?,1
9734,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lol.<br>Ok, now you smart too, relax and go back to  your scene.",1
9735,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks do matter once you accept that life will be easier. You cant control what other people think of you so just let it go. I advice you to live life on your own terms go for your dreams and do what makes you happy you only have one life dont waste it being a victim of society standard.,1
9736,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"bravo, brave woman!",1
9737,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She did a great job.,1
9738,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;d marry this girl.. shes pretty, honest and smart.",1
9739,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am a mother and I see the effects the influence of those who create the perfect images we see on a magazine has on young girls and women. Now in my 40&#39;s I can appreciate the artistic value that goes into creating a front page vogue picture, which is how I interpret the photos. At 49 and with all the plastic surgery in the world, I know I will never look the model on the front page of Vogue, but I dowant those shoes she is wearing. But my 9 year old niece, starring at the magazines whilst her mother pays for the groceries, sees someone to aspire too. She looks at her skin, and thinks Im not normal because my skin is dark, I want white skin. She stares at her belly and wishes it will go away so shestops eating icecream. If you can not eat ice cream when you are 9 when can you eat it.I thank Cameron for her honesty, but even more then that, for educating and motivating our young girls to aspire to be more then what they ever believed they could be.  I have to question how many of us judged Cameron because she is toobeautiful, how many believed she was not smart enough to do a Ted Talk. We all have gifts, and if you are privelleged to live in a Western society then you are so lucky because you get to choose how to use that gift.",1
9740,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"maybe heart felt, but it annoyed me to watch.",1
9741,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"why is she panting, she is a model!",1
9742,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks do matter, sadly. When I was in middle school I wore plain clothing, had unkempt, wild hair, wore glasses and had acne. I had no friend &amp; people would bully me bc of my acne, wild hair that I was reading books all the time and that I was a &quot;Nerd&quot;.<br>This made me change a lot as I got into a highschool. I straightend my hair, got rid of my acne due to birthcontrol, wore contacts and got a more feminine clothing style. <br>And what? I was accepted by the other kids. I got friends. People wanted to talk to me and even asked politely what I read at the moment. Some months later I got my first kiss, something I could never dream of in middle school. <br>Sadly, looks really do matter a lot and good looking people are getting more accepted by others, have more friends and so they are happier than others. I wish it wouldn&#39;t be like that.",1

9765,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is the most down to earth non delusional person the title might not be accurate of what she&#39;s talking about but that&#39;s what Ted talks are about! Many people don&#39;t realize,1
9766,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oh great, right off the bat she brings race into it.",1
9767,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks mean nothing women or girls shouldn&#39;t be so focussed on looks but focused on their persanality,1
9768,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think what she is talking about a role about how women dress up to express their personality and show some happiness.,1
9769,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I can&#39;t help but notice how just a touch of humility and honesty make a person so much more attractive. Beauty IN=beauty OUT.,1

But in the end: ugly wants to be pretty, poor wants to be wealthy; pretty does NOT want to become ugly, and wealthy does NOT want to become poor. These kind of talks instantly fall under: pretty white girl wants sympathy for being born privileged. Alright, alright, she can get mine - wow, is she beautiful:)",1

9795,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is unhappy with her fake appearance on the magazines and billboards (I suppose) But I believe Cameron is really good person herself besides being a person she always have to be in front   of the cameras and the spotlight. She is unique on her own!,1
9796,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Interesting,1
9797,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Extremely honest and truthful talk leaving us with an important thing to ponder on.,1
9798,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;ve gotten over the fact that I feel ugly. I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve accepted what I look like because I am healthy. And that&#39;s the most important!,1

It may look easier when you&#39;re looking at it from the outside, but unfortunately you don&#39;t know that being conventionally attractive has its hardships and downsides, too. Don&#39;t look at things so superficially -- free drinks and avoiding speeding tickets doesn&#39;t equate to an easier life.",1

9810,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Of course she would say looks aren&#39;t everything lol. She already has the looks...,1
9811,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=5m30s"">5:30</a> yea, how about attend a college, do social work for 10-20 years, and actually benefit a society like other politicians, then you can be a president with a 10year modelling experience prior.",1
9812,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Judging from my ex&#39;s new fling this rings so true,1
9813,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So, the models will be insecure too... who cares? They are still benefiting from their looks and treated better.",1
9814,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The lady meant well, but she only convinced sad ugly people to get sadder and just because she said pretty people aren&#39;t always happy doesn&#39;t make the sad any happier.",1
9815,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=2m11s"">2:11</a> wait what??!! clearly she doesnt know the power of making gainz",1
9816,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,her saying looks isn&#39;t everything believe me i&#39;m a model <br>is like a milliore saying money isn&#39;t everything believe me i&#39;m rich but if you asked him to give you all of his money <br>everything changes,1
9817,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People say I can be a model... By I more want to be a photographer.,1
9818,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,love it!! thank you!!!,1
9819,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How convenient of her to have this epiphany after her modeling days came to an end!,1
9820,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The key fallacy here is the presumption that there&#39;s inherent virtue in being unattractive, or that sacrificing kindness or smarts is a necessity to being attractive and rich. Those girls you ask Cameron, they realize that while being smart and kind is important, there are unique advantages to being rich or attractive. Advantages you not only seem to take for granted - but also refer to like a curse - all while continuing your career as a super model. Like it or not, that IS hypocritical.",1
9821,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So make yourself ugly. People who aren&#39;t good looking don&#39;t believe it&#39;s the end-all solution to all lives&#39; problems. But this is like hearing from someone that&#39;s been a millionaire all her life that &quot;money isn&#39;t everything&quot; - honestly, you really have zero idea unless you&#39;ve been without so why even pretend you do.<br><br>So many girls I&#39;ve met have the biggest hearts, are generous and smart, but struggle to find and keep guys just because they don&#39;t have the looks. You might say &quot;well then that guy is no good anyway&quot; but reality is not that simple -- it hurts anyway, and looks matter a lot even for good guys. <br><br>Point remains, that someone attractive can become ugly as soon as they want, whereas someone unattractive can&#39;t just wave a magic wand and become hot. That&#39;s why the former in any case is preferrable to the latter, and this talk just comes across as arrogant and whiny.",1
9822,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is one of the shorter ted videos I&#39;ve seen and people in the comments section are still having trouble seeing it through ._. Amazing.,1
9823,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You may be a model but did not know that you have a major in economics and political science. Perfect example of beauty and brain.,1
9824,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wish she&#39;d answered the question she does the job anyways,1
9825,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really liked what she meant to say. The presentation could&#39;ve been better but who cares. Not easy to deliver a perfect speech,1
9826,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oxygen  isn&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m from Jupiter.",1
9827,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Pals OMFG timing I really please   ix c&quot;lot patient  ! !,1
9828,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she is verypretty and I agree that an image is powerfulyet superficial. I admire her courageand honesty to talk about how she thought about beauty. Frankly, I am jealous of attractive people and how they can attract others only with their looks. However,superficial beauty will sooner or later leave us all as we get wrinkly and old. But we all know beautiful mind will glow brighter even after you are gone. So for those with beautiful mind, keep it going. We are only here for flash of a moment in time anyways. Be nice to others regardless of how they look.",1
9829,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Another TED fail.<br><br>How stupid must people be to go to these things.,1
9830,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One of the best ted talks I&#39;ve seen, incredible :)",1
9831,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This was badly titled, really.",1
9832,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,can people actually LISTEN TO WHAT THE MODEL IS SAYING? Before commenting trash please pay attentiion to the video,1
9833,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,to her Little self &quot;You can be the President of the united States&quot;<br> Donald Trump Shows that no Grand dad is racist for that Job xD!,1
9834,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In today&#39;s advanced and modern society, looks define who you are, your job, your friends, your social life, your sexual life . Sadly, if you are average or below average looking , your life as a human being is not as worthy as someone who is good looking. If you were born ugly then you are and will always be <del>in every aspect of life</del> inferior to a pretty person.",1
9835,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Love her,1
9836,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks will fade over time........your inner being won&#39;t,1
9837,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Of course they&#39;re not everything, if you&#39;re hot.",1
9838,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The 1st is just loving urself! Really if u love yourself n if u trust u will be the best!!,1
9839,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just by the title, being a model doesn&#39;t mean you are pretty or even good looking. There are a lot of ugly models.<br>If you do a benefit ranking system, based only on how you look, you might get (starting from the bottom):<br>1: Men with facial tattoos (people get scared)<br>2: Skinny men with glasses (get ignored and underestimated)<br>3: Any man (skin colour irrelevant) with bad teeth<br>4: Fat men (body fat percentage 50%+)<br>5: Men that doesn&#39;t look trained (work out less than 6 hours a week, powerlifters and off-season bodybuilders)<br>6: Bodybuilders (Roid rage will put you equal to men with facial tattoos)<br>7: Men that work out between 6 and 14 hours a week, but have decent muscle definition<br>8: Fat, bitchy and stupid women<br>9: Overbearing women<br>10: Fat women<br>11: Fat smart women (being smart will only get you so much)<br>12: Average women<br>13: 36-24-36 women (even if slightly stupid)<br>14: Pretty women<br>15: Pretty smart women<br>16: Pretty 36-24-36  women<br>17: Pretty and smart 36-24-36 women<br>Then there are obvious cultural differences, and there are more gradations that could be done.",1
9840,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,screw you and your gene pool you good looking smart woman,1
9841,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything which is exactly why I&#39;ve made my whole entire living off my looks lol. What a fucking joke TED has turned into,1
9842,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think her point is that in society looks Do matter and that&#39;s why she managed to get away with things that other people who aren&#39;t so &quot;gifted&quot;, according to society standards of beauty or style do not, just based on first impressions and she means that it SHOULD NOT happen. Her changing clothes went to people stop paying attention to her clothes to actually listening to what she was saying and when she showed her normal pictures against her professional photos it meant that the professional picture portrayed what society wanted or craved but it was not who she really is thus many models are insecure because they cannot be who they really are in public because they must live up to everyone&#39;s standard. Example: They will freak out more over the possibility of looking a bit heavier in a picture or having a bad hair day than the average person because their career and self esteem depends mainly based on that (on looks). Which she means it is wrong.",1
9843,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m now really smart I just watched a ted video.,1
9844,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What Cameron means about-the power of image in our perceived successes and perceived failures-she is not happy and is trying to make a mission to make beauty about brains, about our insides. She is clearly addicted to her professions hold on her life because she continues to do it, but some do this so they will be heard, because again they feel if they don&#39;t no one will pay attention anymore. So she has in fact proven that the power of image has a hold on her, so let&#39;s pray for her because she is not really happy and money does not equal happiness.",1
9845,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"God these comments applauding her are cancerous. She&#39;s attractive. We get it. She&#39;s somewhat intelligent and had graduated from college. Great. The issue is NOT about the message. The issue is about her credibility to even communicate her message. She chose to capitalise on her looks to become a model. Absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, her talk on human flourishing is so vacuous. What else has she done that isn&#39;t modelling?",1
9846,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are subjective. Society has all of these views of beauty and what it is and what it isn&#39;t but beneath it all none of it matters. It&#39;s a frame of mind.,1
9847,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,radicalchic,1
9848,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;If you say you wanna be the president of the United States but your reseme reads Model 10 years, people will give you a funny look.&quot; That&#39;s actually kinda deep. Reminds me of Elle in Legally Blonde.",1
9849,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love how people decide to make this a sjw issue when her message has much more to do with being comfortable in your own skin,1
9850,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"For those that think models are stupid and dumb, here&#39;s the exception.",1
9851,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; - brought to you by a super cutie,1
9852,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,WHY IS EVERYONE IN THE COMMENTS BEING SO BITCHY?! She&#39;s definitely not saying: your look isn&#39;t everything. What she&#39;s saying is that the treatment from others regarding that topic is unfair.,1
9853,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How to enjoy any video?<br>Never read the comment section,1
9854,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If looks aren&#39;t everything libraries wouldn&#39;t be so empty,1
9855,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Deal with it.,1
9856,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You know, it would make more sense if the person speaking used to be very beautiful, but was disfigured due to an accident and she says &quot;looks aren`t everything&quot;. The person needs to be on both sides of the spectrum before making those kind of lectures.",1
9857,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,53% seriously ??? Those kids are crazy or what ???,1
9858,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow! Thank you for sharing! I&#39;m white and pretty and due to my religion, was never able to be the model I always wanted to do. I am now pursuing a criminal justice and law degree so that o can help society become a better environment and to fight for victims to get what they deserve. Up and until this point I still wished I can be a model l, actress, si g or even dance in public. Yet , you just helped me realize that just because someone looks happy in that magazine, isn&#39;t always happy. I really appreciate your honesty and empowered speech!!! Thank you!!!",1
9859,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No one knows her, and everyone know who Kim Kardashian is, and she is rich as well. People even know who Farrah Abraham is ! ",1
9860,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sure, money is also something.",1
9861,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful Talk.,1
9862,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I didn&#39;t expect this to be a deep.,1
9863,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Obviously nobody&#39;s life is perfect, but she will never know what it means to be genetically denied a career in certain areas and in others having to constantly fight to get somewhere even though you don&#39;t look perfect. We live in a visual society, looking good is the best thing that can happen to you if you are striving for a job that somehow depends on this society. Of course that doesn&#39;t mean good looking people are excepted of the hardships average people are, but starting already in the kindergarden, lower than average people have a much tougher time than beautiful people, and mostly they are the cause. This is the horrible truth of the matter, I would like to hear if she has anything useful to say about that.",1
9864,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So, what&#39;s the point of this talk? I mean, she did raise some good points, but they&#39;re mostly common sense and there doesn&#39;t seem to be an overall interesting message that she&#39;s trying to deliver.",1
9865,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ummm....  Sure..,1
9866,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"God, these comments, why do you watch ted talks without the sufficient comprehension skills to understand, she made an interesting point and she&#39;s clearly a smart person but seems like no one gets it.",1
9867,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s saying that looks do matter but not for achieving happiness! Being pretty opens doors but if that door is SOLELY opened because of your looks then it will most likely lead to cliff edges, be it someone wanting &quot;favours&quot;, people not taking you seriously, etc..",1
9868,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"para que entiendan las feministas el poder de las mujeres y en cima q seas hermosa, te RE facilita las cosas. Para un hombre no tanto :)",1
9869,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I always use to think that all models are bimbo but watching this video changed my opinion,1
9870,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Didnt know about her before. After, she&#39;s hands down my favorite model. Why? <br>Intelligent. She is intelligent, and that is probably her sexiest quality",1
9871,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I hate when good-looking people says  &quot;looks arent everything&quot;,1
9872,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,beauty with braine!!,1
9873,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sometimes I can see people treat me differently because I&#39;m not attractive (despite my best efforts and money spent), but ultimately I can say I&#39;m not lonely and when I am unhappy, it&#39;s usually a consequence of my own choices.",1
9874,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you&#39;re pretty (she&#39;s referring to as &quot;image&quot;), like her, you get it easy even without skills - easy job, easy get away from cop, free stuff, etc. But on the other hand, some who aren&#39;t pretty or different (in terms of race, etc.) will not get it easy despite having all the best skills and talent written in their resume. The importance of &quot;image&quot; and what is put out there as the &quot;good one&quot; can be the main cause that some people who are different from the supposed &quot;image&quot; is still being held down in a society.",1
9875,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Being beautiful makes life easy. Being beautiful and thin makes life even more easy. Being beautiful, thin, white, and rich apparently makes you evil!! That leads to suicidal...welcome to a first world WORLD!!",1

9881,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She was grateful but still, she did not understand the true suffering of some people. If she was really interested in helping other people, she would have stopped by and rallied longer for people to take a stand against racism/ugliness.<br><br>You can even argued that she had an agenda: She&#39;s trying to get a viral video of herself and she&#39;s a smart actor.",1

9883,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,beauty fades and dumb is forever,1
9884,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"well, ask it from a person who&#39;s <b>ugly</b>! Obviously, prettier people have it far far better, they can SELL their genetic beauty, make money out of it! Ugly ones have to work hard to survive in this judgemental/looks-conscious world we live in!",1
9885,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just came here to dislike for the title,1
9886,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This was more or less 10 minutes of her basically saying, hey, I&#39;m good looking and I&#39;m in the position I&#39;m in because of my looks. Great. What&#39;s next? Bill Gates speaking to people about how money isn&#39;t everything?",1
9887,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this is why women in music should be fired cause everyone just wants to bang them and thats why they sell records is cause it makes men hard lol,1

9889,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wish she would stop trying to be funny. My face muscles are getting sore from cringing so much.,1
9890,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I always come back and watch this video. She&#39;s so honest and down to earth. Also, I love the way she talks. No stammering or stuttering ( not that those things are anything to be ashamed of ) but her voice is so pretty and what she says is so logical and intelligent.",1
9891,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ok was really trying hard to watch this but it&#39;s dumb bye,1
9892,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s the bomb,1
9893,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Brave thing for someone to lay it all out like this, and tell us how it&#39;s pretty much all a lie (or, at best, a truth so bent you wouldn&#39;t recognise it). TV tells us every day what we &quot;should&quot; like. Are YOU immune?",1
9894,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,just wow,1
9895,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks matter this is real life honey.,1
9896,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She looks like a younger version of Cindy Crawford,1

9899,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Money isn&#39;t everything, unless you haven&#39;t got any. Same goes for looks. If you are in the position to say looks aren&#39;t everything you are a rich person downplaying the importance and influence of wealth.",1

Sorry.",1
9901,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why does she seem so out of breath,1
9902,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,smart !,1
9903,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,First of all model doesn&#39;t equal pretty. Look at all the high fashion models. Their looks are so extreme and high fashion models are not usually &quot;pretty&quot;,1

9910,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;besides surgery there is very little you can do&quot; eat healthy and working out gos a long way. hot men and hot woman are different. also the &quot;white skin&quot; is sexual dismorphism not racism. men like light skin because its associated with calm, purity , stuff like that its evolution not racism. woman prefers darker skin because its associated with masculine  trates but you never hear its cos of racism then.its only when white is more desirable does racism get brought up cos anti white bigotry is mainstream.",1

9916,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was eye opening <br>Loved it,1
9917,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"it sucks that today&#39;s world has come to the point where we need to be told that looks and capabilities are two very different things. a lot of people here in the comments are saying that looks do matter because people judge you over it, but I guess we can also say that looks don&#39;t matter, which is why you shouldn&#39;t judge people over it. (note how in the case of this video looks&quot; refers to not even whether a person looks healthiness, cleanliness, authenticity but simply to socially constructed ideas of beauty)",1
9918,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m a skinny ugly guy. I don&#39;t think it has really held me back from doing things. Ive been able to find employment and own a house and a car and have travelled to some different places. <br><br>I find at least for me when you are not attractive most people are not really mean to you its just they sort of ignore you. But I suppose when I do talk to people at least I know its because they are interested in what I have to say rather than nodding their head waiting until they get the chance to bone me.,1

9921,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So to sum up: It&#39;s not fair she cashed in on modeling. My thought: It&#39;s not fair to cash in on saying it&#39;s not fair. You took the money, now STFU and enjoy your privileged life.",1

9929,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I understand her point, that beauty doesn&#39;t buy you happiness, but come on... it gives you a huge head start. She says she&#39;s insecure, but so are a lot of people, and she&#39;s never had to suffer rejection based on the way she looks. She has probably been accepted by everyone she&#39;s ever met, had a straight forward career in modelling, clear life direction, and had a lot of fun in the process. If her main insecurity in life is scrutinising the way she looks, looking like that, then I wish I had her life. I found her message quite patronising.",1
9930,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah it isn&#39;t everything but here you are with &quot;I&#39;m a model&quot; in the title of the video,1

9935,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Look is not about genes. At least not only about genes. It&#39;s an attitude. An attitude toward others and yourself. If there&#39;s somebody important you wanna impress, or you really care about others&#39; opinions on you, you&#39;ll pull off the best look you can get even if it may be fake because it&#39;s worth the time and effort.",1
9936,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I dunno, her struggles are the struggles most women go through (model or not) only she&#39;s better off as she gets paid, sponsored, fame etc. Sure modelling is not all &#39;happy&#39;, but no job is. The benefits you get from modelling outweigh those of an average 9-5 job (where you don&#39;t get to travel, you don&#39;t get free clothing, you don&#39;t get paid much, you work long hours and do repetitive tasks, work with the same old people, in a grey cubicle). She says that she feels that people judge her based on her looks, and focus less on her values and personality; yet, this could be said for an uglier person. Everyone is judged based on looks (pretty or not), it&#39;s unconscious bias. I&#39;m not pretty, I&#39;ve been judged based on my looks - they say I look introverted, not friendly, socially awkward, all because I&#39;m lanky, not bright-faced, frizzy hair etc. They don&#39;t care that I&#39;m actually genuinely friendly and outgoing.<br><b>I&#39;d rather have her struggles than that of an ugly person</b> because while a lot are similar, you actually get some sort of benefit from being pretty.<br>That part she said about modelling as a young girl; those uncomfortable poses etc. You had the choice, and you pursued modelling. You can change career paths, despite what you said about how unappealing &#39;underwear model for 10 years&#39; on a resume seems, there are many models who have moved on successfully! Miranda Kerr has her own business now; And if it weren&#39;t for her &#39;fame&#39;, her business would not have been nearly as successful. Being famous, and pretty gives you a lot of benefits that the average &#39;ugly&#39; person won&#39;t get.",1

I am also insecure&quot; what a big news... everybody is insecure !!

9953,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m pretty sure the gist of this wasn&#39;t that looks do t matter, I think it was about how people want to look like models but cant because it&#39;s genetic and even models don&#39;t look like models because they are airbrushed. Another point was models don&#39;t have an amzing lives as everybody always thinks, they are insecure. The other one was about how girls weren&#39;t happy with their bodies and bought the model way was THE way but why would you aspire to be a thin, hungry, insecure airbrushed lady when you could be anything you want?",1
9954,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This TED talk was a total humble brag,1
9955,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You can&#39;t be discussing how incredibly insecure you are about your body to these millions of people right now. There is a clear privilege in the world for women that look like yourself. Women can&#39;t get jobs, respect, or even enjoy their lives because of their appearance. Young men and women developed eating disorders and negative thoughts about their bodies from incredibly young ages. Regardless of your insecurities, you have privilege to be a pretty, white woman in this world. I understand that you pointed that out, but how could you even compare yourself to other people of different races, or appearance in general. Your insecurities are not the same. Not even close.",1

9958,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"not a great talker for me, but i would love to listen to her the next time she writes another speech",1
9959,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The message here is a little blurry. I think this talk needs a bit more clarity because she contradicts herself a lot. Here is a womanon the boarder ofintegrity because she knows that she is adding to an industry that makes typical, averagedsized woman and childrenfeel insecure however she brags about it, in saying she won the lottery in the looks department and cashed in. If she knows that it is discriminating then she should talk about how she doesn&#39;t like the industry. No one in their right mind is going to feel sorry for a rich model (who hasmade money off of their looks) who is secretly insecure, because they do have tons of above average privilege. AlsoHER images leads to eating disorders in those little girls she talks about. So where is her accountability, where is her apology for contributing to that? This talk needs work.",1
9960,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So you won the lottery.  You have no right telling people that have not won, that it doesn&#39;t matter much.  You have lived your life in positive bias because of your looks.  You think there are times it doesn&#39;t matter, but it always matters.",1

Thank you for making me feel like utter waste.,1

A black woman can be drop dead gorgeous, an 8,9 or even a 10 on the beauty scale, but most people, especially men, won&#39;t notice because she is black. A white woman may be a 5 and will get more attention from men than the black woman who is physically more attractive.

10066,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m a 47 year old white male and I&#39;ve never been comfortable with my looks.,1
10067,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If a model start her career at 16 and retire at 26, she can still go to top college learn anything she wants or changing career... It&#39;s way much exciting than being an officer...Honestly I think her life is great! She&#39;s just a bit insecure, but most women feel insecure no matter what. YOUNG BEAUTIFUL GIRLS: If you want to be a model, be confident and catch all the chances!!!",1
10068,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She takes her beauty for granted...,1
10069,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, even the people who appear to have everything can still be insecure and unhappy. This video hit me hard",1
10070,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is like a rich person saying &quot;money isnt everything.&quot;<br>Then give me your money. Didnt think so.,1
10071,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Disgusting ... <br>she may be relationship with black boyfriend,1
10072,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Image is superficial. We are all feel insecure about how we look so that others would accept us who we are. We clothe our nakedness so that we feel secure.,1
10073,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,White people dominate international modelling the way black people dominate basketball.  They on average have the most attractive phenotype. We now have greater understanding of genetics. So we can manipulate the genetic lottery now.,1
10074,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great speech over all but I wish all young women were as beautiful as you at 16. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=5m39s"">5:39</a>",1
10075,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When I get pulled over, I&#39;ll just make sure that I have a Halle Berry mask in the glove box. ",1
10076,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A pretty face, but I do not understand how anyone can think a woman with a skinny, shapeless body, one that looks like a 12 year old boy...looks good.",1
10077,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I didn&#39;t heard advice from her speech. She talked about herself only..a kind of self-promotion,1
10078,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,that make no sense,1
10079,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t know this model,1
10080,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,if this woman was what people call ugly nobody would have listened or cared,1
10081,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,can someone translate her last sentence? &quot;image is what we awknowledge in our precieved failures &quot; ? what does that mean? can someone simplify that?,1
10082,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow.,1
10083,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s funny how these feel-good talks are always held by people who don&#39;t know the opposite.<br>Talks about money: held by rich people.<br>Talks about looks: held by beautiful people/models.<br>Talks about happiness: people who grew up in a wealthy/good household.<br>Talks about how bad social media is: held by people who become successful/famous through social media.,1
10084,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for being honest :-),1
10085,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is incredible, she is so brutally honest about herself and really shines a light on the industry. I applaud her.",1
10086,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What&#39;s the moral to the story? Looks aren&#39;t everything? Brilliant I learned that in kindergarten.,1
10087,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If it&#39;s not everything, then what is?!?",1
10088,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,no entendi muito bem,1
10089,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"that is how the world works, natural selection.",1
10090,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are just as beautiful from the inside as u are from the outside. Girls with idealistic goals which they are probably never going to achieve need to see this. This was a refreshing reminder for me as well that perfection does not guarantee happiness.,1
10091,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why is she so out of breath the entire time?,1
10092,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,her cardio is weak..,1
10093,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So the beauty in the industry is white pretty women? Good luck for   fighting racial discrimination...  We have a long path to achieve,1
10094,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Life isn&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a life.",1
10095,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wait did she make a point?,1
10096,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great message but she isnt white...,1
10097,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Amazing speech, looks really aren&#39;t everything, I doubt people even paid attention to what she said or just commented after reading the title. I&#39;m a really attractive girl &amp; everyone I meet tells me that, but I&#39;ve had low self esteem for years &amp; my looks don&#39;t help in making me happy. I feel even more insecure despite of having good looks. Happiness doesn&#39;t come from beauty, it never will",1
10098,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she says looks aren&#39;t everything but she got a lot of thinks with her looks ,1
10099,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She didn&#39;t mean looks aren&#39;t everything, she meant even though she has good looks, she&#39;s insecure and not always happy. She knows that being &quot;pretty&quot; has benefits, but feels that they&#39;re usually unfair.",1
10100,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Brave,1
10101,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,people are listening because she is damn beautiful,1
10102,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I believe that everyone is beautiful. For some it may be their intelligence, a specific talent, audacity, their attitude. We just need to recognise our beauty spot.",1
10103,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"of course looks aren&#39;t everything, they only count for about 90%, the other 10% is up to you",1
10104,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What? Sorry, I didn&#39;t hear a word she said, I was too busy admiring her beauty",1
10105,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"in the first 2 minutes it looks like if she was laughing just so people would laugh, because the crowd was quiet af lol",1
10106,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;d marry her !:-),1
10107,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s so dumb and unfunny,1
10108,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"simple, funny, and honest",1
10109,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To be honest, if she wasn&#39;t that tall, her face is just average.",1
10110,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Race has NOTHING to do with success idiot.,1
10111,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m a gay North Korean cissy? Don&#39;t judge my books by their covers cuz they are actually pretty good to read late at night, m&#39;key?",1
10112,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks matter....sometimes even more than brains. the ugly person word hard to achieve the best while the pretty person can just marry into the best.,1
10113,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel guilty bc I clicked this video for her looks,1
10114,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So inspirational,1
10115,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ok well then money must not be everything.,1
10116,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m rich and beautifull but I still have problems... First world problems... GTFO,1
10117,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I totally know that looks are nothing but for an average person like me who has no extraordinary events happening in life , looks , do matter , maybe a bit but they still have a place , I don&#39;t know about others but I do wish to be pretty , I know I&#39;m completely wrong but...",1
10118,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,yeah interesting but let&#39;s be honest  many things can be easier for the pretty ones,1
10119,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Money isn&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a millionaire.&quot;",1
10120,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,such heavy breathing.she must of been nervous,1
10121,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was raw beauty and courageous of her to speak an her journey and her feelings about life and race and image.,1
10122,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"beauty fades, character blossoms.",1
10123,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The title itself is already a sarcasm. I cant take this talk seriously.,1
10124,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i&#39;m only watching this because she&#39;s hot,1
10125,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Go Cameron!,1
10126,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this comes off as exagerated to me as a model and actor I understand where she is coming from but I know plenty of female models repped by my agency(s) who do not fit this traditional standard of &quot;white&quot; beauty. plus i know a lot of female models who eat more than me, they dont do these crazy starvation diets. but all in all it was a thoughtful well planned talk. I suppose I cant talk because I have had such a good experience with my looks but i dont think that many young girls feel insecure.",1
10127,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is so courageous. Bravo.,1
10128,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"looks aint everything, while shes blessed with genes of an angel",1
10129,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I hate being short. I understand maybe my problems wouldn&#39;t go away if I was taller, I would just probably find something else to be sad about. But yeah it&#39;s refreshing to have someone admit that they have an easier path to finding happiness than others because of the genetic lottery. On the other hand, I acknowledge what she&#39;s saying about basically  the lack of as strong a link between attractiveness and happiness as people might think. It&#39;s definitely there but those lucky people still have to also deal with problems and find their way, even though they might have more social capital buoying them up in the meantime.",1
10130,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,shes still beautiful,1
10131,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,My teacher showed this and many other of your videos.. They are very inspiring,1
10132,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wonderful video... thank you,1
10133,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the title already made me laugh so hard <br>It&#39;s pretty much the same as <br>a koala saying &quot;Sleeping isn&#39;t everything,i&#39;m a koala&quot;",1
10134,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,just sucking lagugh ....noting less,1
10135,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything. That&#39;s why we decompose and rot to nothing in the end.,1
10136,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why did I feel like the speech ended too short,1
10137,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I got a little bit chocked when she said &quot;I&#39;m insecure&quot; even her insecurity it&#39;s very clear when she speaks. idk, they sell this image that models are ALWAYS super secure and have this awesome makeup always, and beautiful clothes... yep, they&#39;re selling it.",1
10138,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she is honest and very pretty, may god bless u",1
10139,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why so tired?,1
10140,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Unfortunately, it is not easy to change people from judging another by their appearance. If not appearance, it is by expression which potentially does not make less people feel bad about themselves. <br><br>Inner strength is definitely the more important quality for a person to be happy especially for those who are more insecure and constantly fear of being judged negatively. Good thing about this strength is that it can be trained.",1
10141,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Is it ironic that she is not attractive?,1
10142,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"you&#39;re all morons, and misinformed about reality. but nice try.",1
10143,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Tall &amp; pretty people get better jobs and get more income and free stuff. Perhaps even more friends.,1
10144,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what is pp....,1
10145,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Being a professional model and being upset about beauty ideals, photoreaks and etc. is hypocritical.She has chosen the profession in which all these things are selected.",1
10146,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It is easy for her to say, ask any average looking person. Seen a guy at work who cannot write one line in English language properly got 2 big promotions within 6 months. All bcoz of good looks. And hardworking men who gave 15 years to organization got fired so that this Prince Charming can be placed at their position. Just make a fake profile with average looking stock photo pics and try to chat with good looking men. Looks are everything! Although it does not guarantee happiness but crying in Mercedes is much comfortable than crying in subway.",1
10147,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The truth is: Everyone can be a model you &quot;only&quot; need strict excercise and food regime,1
10148,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,valiente,1
10149,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,@6.07 she looks gorgeous in the photo on the right,1
10150,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this was such a good talk but in all honesty, dayuuuum she is smoking and finer than anything halal out their.",1
10151,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s only saying this because she&#39;s hot ,1
10152,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beauty does really matter but its sure not everything, am hot but really depressed most of the time",1
10153,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,pretty hurts...,1
10154,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What is a legacy? It&#39;s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see,1
10155,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,they arent everything but it fuckin helps. and why would i believe a hot person saying that if shes NEVER experienced being ugly before,1
10156,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think humans are generally very high achievers when it comes to happiness. <br><br>We seek happiness and satisfaction especially in trying to achieve things we don&#39;t have yet. And once we have achieved it, it doesn&#39;t satisfy us to do the same thing again. We can go and find happiness in something else. You can pick up the guitar and try to learn it. You become a legend at it one day and suddenly it bores you. It doesn&#39;t satisfy you anymore. You move on. To another instrument and repeat the same thing. <br><br>&#39;Looks aren&#39;t everything&#39; is so subjective honestly. Take that and apply it to the way we look. The people who are already good looking because of the genetic lottery are not satisfied anymore by their looks and it doesn&#39;t make them happy. They seek happiness in other things. To these people their own looks aren&#39;t everything. <br><br>People who don&#39;t have good genes may have achieved other things that don&#39;t make them happy anymore. But they want to be beautiful. In their head they will never be happy until they think they&#39;re good looking. Looks are everything to them.  <br><br>One thing about being good looking is the benefits you receive in life. The attention, probably more positive behaviour from others. This can really upset you if you&#39;re treated less because of your looks. It damages your confidence. <br><br>The effects of thinking you&#39;re ugly are terrible.  It truly is in your head.  Looks aren&#39;t everything but a damage of confidence can prove to counter your social life drastically. You could become distracted, obsessive. It gets in the way of your life and your relationships. How many opportunities will you miss? &#39;She/he probably won&#39;t want to date me, I&#39;m ugly&#39; have you ever though that? That&#39;s damaged confidence from low self esteem. You ever been shopping and not even tried on an article of clothing because &#39;I probably don&#39;t pull it off&#39;? You ever stood next to a friend and thought it&#39;s better if you just stood under their shadow?<br><br>You really won&#39;t REALISE how important your looks are unless you&#39;re on the side where you feel insecure about it a lot. You don&#39;t feel this side and that&#39;s why looks aren&#39;t everything. It&#39;s subjective. Looks can be everything and can not mean it as well",1
10157,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is a crap talk that makes no sense , she just proved that models are stupid !",1
10158,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You can only do so much about your appearance, people. If you don&#39;t look beautiful, that&#39;s okay. You can still work to look better, but don&#39;t let it consume your life. And if you are beautiful, then that&#39;s okay too. Others shouldn&#39;t hate you for what you were born with. It&#39;s a blessing to have what you have. Everybody should embrace how they are and acknowledge their flaws, but at the same time try to improve whatever they can IF they want to. I hope this helps at least someone out there.",1
10159,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Pretty girls are insecure about their looks because looks might become their identity, that they need to try very hard to protect. It may be come what they define themselves with, which is perhaps why they feel so scared once it&#39;s challenged or deemed &quot;not good enough.&quot;",1
10160,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Is she really being nervous or faking it because people in the fashion industry are trained to be like actors. Seriously First World Problems. I don&#39;t pity her at all because her and other models own insecurities are nothing compared to the 99% who didn&#39;t win the genetic lottery.,1
10161,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Shes just being honest i can feel how she feels insecure, akward and super aware of every of her words cause most ppl could take it the wrong way. She is right bout what she is sayin only thing that is fact is that uhm she is used to be criticized on her looks more than her words thats why it seems to me its hard for her to get to ppl. uhm she was awesome i loved the changing outfits thing she did in the beginning it means a lot its such a powerful message just that action. so great she is beautiful and a lil confusing which in my experience also works good for a person but it doesnt feel as good as it seems. so claps for her!!! and i luved the video.",1
10162,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"being pretty can be a disadvantage too, pretty girls are often believed to not be as smart as average looking people especially in the technical field",1
10163,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not only white girls benefit from being beautiful. It&#39;s the same for beautiful non-white girls as it is for white girls.,1
10164,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow..,1
10165,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,beauty and brains.......how can they be in one single package???,1
10166,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You can&#39;t be president but you could be president&#39;s wife. That might help you to climb your career ladder! ;-P,1
10167,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"im good looking guy but that doesn&#39;t mean that i get want,skills and talent do matter.Even though im good looking my life isn&#39;t that happening with cool friends.Also good looking people are highly misunderstood",1
10168,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"all this comments make me sad, well lucky me I&#39;m good looking LOL",1
10169,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I literally can&#39;t stop thinking all the time about how differently I get treated when I am dressed up compared to when  I&#39;m dressed down by people of the public! It baffles me every time. After work I used to go buy my bus fair from these two guys, and I worked in designer fashion so I would be all dressed up with heels and looking nice and these two guys were incredibly lovely and so kind to me, smiley, all of the above. Then one day I got changed after work into more comfy clothes cause I felt better that way and the guys barely even gave me a smile and they approached me so differently. I think it is incredibly awful the way this works, I always make my best to be so friendly with everyone and smiling but it&#39;s more likely people certain people respond to that when I&#39;m looking all done up.",1
10170,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This opened my mind and literally shocked me from the truth, thank you for the great advice. I will start becoming more happy with myself from now on. I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m thick, or if I&#39;m thin, or if I&#39;m average. I&#39;m simply ME. And I&#39;m proud of who I am.",1

10174,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,residential future album danger white model.,1
10175,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Love this talk. She inspires me ,1
10176,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,so honest so true. beautiful person she!!,1
10177,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Every single person has insecurities. It&#39;s human. But looks fade, clever mind and a kind heart doesn&#39;t. You can decide what you want to focus on and what&#39;s more important for you.",1
10178,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She never said that look doesn&#39;t matter, in fact she proved by examples that looks do matter in this world BUT she is against it. And she talked about how images can be superficial and how having good looks doesn&#39;t make you always happy... Her struggle is that she doesn&#39;t think looks should have such big control on our lives but she is precisely the biggest beneficiary of this whole phenomenon so it is kind of an awkward situation. I feel like this talk doesn&#39;t have one very clear message, but it somehow left a strong impression on me after watching it like a year ago. Always appreciate people who are eager to point out not-so-glorious stuffs in the field they are working!",1
10179,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Damn, I wonder what it&#39;s like to have men fall over themselves just to say &#39;hi&#39; to you. I also wonder why I am vaguely envious of super pretty chicks. Oh well, at least I have weed.",1
10180,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are not everything, yes true but you gotta admit, it has many advantages. You say that looks are not everything because you yourself is already pretty and you dont really get to experience the &#39;hardships&#39; and criticisms of being not so fortunate on the physical appearance department",1
10181,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I see redundant comments about &quot;looks isn&#39;t everything but it sure helps a lot&quot;. If we just cut out all BS and consider the appearance struggles in society, a person&#39;s look is a type of resource in society of social context it&#39;s unequally and unfairly distributed amongst us, that is part of human life. The truth is that everyone is not free from visual judgement, even being a pretty girl has its great disadvantage for the individual; people will remember and use her for the looks regardless of whatever else she has, it&#39;s a card that she must play or else she will be viewed as stupid, weird, unrealistic, etc. in society. One can compare good looks with being wealthy, except there&#39;s no foundation as she mentioned in the video, it&#39;s a wealth of happiness that will never be long lasting which is we end up seeking in life.",1
10182,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think this talk was great. I don&#39;t understand why people are getting on her case for this talk. She&#39;s trying to send a message here.,1
10183,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i love this bc she unfolds the truth behind being a &#39;model&#39; that most of us specially kids and teens wanted to be. I&#39;ve known other models and had a little research specially to those models that i admire and it turned to be that they&#39;re the opposite of what we see from them and their daily lives or even their true self.,1
10184,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"CLICKBAIT bc this model is the exact reason why people think they&#39;re dumb she just rambles and rambles &#39;believe me! Why? Cuz I am, uuuurm I am, um A MODEL! Yeah!!&#39;",1
10185,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s so good at doing these talks,1
10186,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She did well and I get that people feel divided when listening to someone like her, a member of the elite models establishment, expose certain truths yet try to say something&#39;s not right. And it isn&#39;t. The image obsession is all misogynistic talk but you can&#39;t put everything in one box. One can learn a lot in the modeling, fashion world. It can be art, it can be real, powerful, engaging, rewarding, beautiful, extraordinary, unique. It can all about money or not. I&#39;d say 99% of the people have conflictive feelings about how they look and that will change throughout life, and that&#39;s okay. No one should feel guilty because they are beautiful, stunning or white, for that matter. Sounds like she&#39;s apologizing for being who she is because of the wrongs that other people and society has done. If that dress and high heels make her feel happy, if she enjoys eating them, if she does it because it&#39;s something she feels good in, if no one os forcing her to, then the problem is with those who are judging her and not the image she portrays!",1
10187,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah Models are the most insecure women not the planet I can see that.,1
10188,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s ugly. And not &quot;that&quot; white.,1
10189,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hi looks aren&#39;t everything I&#39;m a model doing a successful Ted talk just cause I look good,1
10190,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for putting the disturbing fact out there. What a bravery!,1
10191,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I hate the commenters here. Were you expecting a quick fix or her to quit? She had 9 minutes and she utilized them well. Very original.,1
10192,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is what I need thank u,1
10193,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you are a model. that why i don&#39;t believe you,1
10194,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Peeps, destroy truly    sounds like pretty stranglLatin  XD",1
10195,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,reminds me of that James Dean film: &quot;money isn&#39;t everything&quot;....&quot;Not when you&#39;ve got it it ain&#39;t&quot;,1
10196,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is great. Thank you for putting it out there.,1
10197,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,sleepy,1
10198,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s a good start. But I really wish she had dug in deeper than that. Social and psychological studies have shown some significant disadvantages of being &quot;attractive&quot;, such as the &quot;insecurity&quot; she talks about and a delay in developing a sense of self-confidence and self-worthiness. Having other people eagerly trying to please you constantly takes away more then it gives when it comes to personal development. It takes away many opportunities to cultivate self discovery, sense of purpose, sympathy for others, setting boundaries, etc. I suppose it&#39;s kind of like being treated as a wealthy person. You can&#39;t escape the tendency to be surrounded by those with their own agenda to get something from you.",1
10199,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t know how I found this video... but i think I reallllllly needed to see it,1
10200,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its easy for people to say that when they are good looking.,1
10201,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow what a beautiful woman, in more ways than just one, and so brave.<br>I am impressed and delighted to see some truths and real self/social reflexion.",1
10202,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,shes a practice girl,1
10203,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Don&#39;t worry about beauty. Looks don&#39;t matter. But disregard the list of benefits you get for being attractive as well as the fact that I am able to condescendingly speak to you about this sensitive sociological topic as a result of my beauty-dependent career&quot;,1
10204,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good talk. It highlights how obsessed our society has become with the concept of image, attractive or not. I respect the fashion industry but it&#39;s dark side has found a way into the rest of society. We&#39;ve strayed away from what makes us better and happier to fearing and worrying about how the world sees us. Sad really",1
10205,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,how real and refreshing. excellent content. well done!,1
10206,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Guess who is getting fired after this :D,1
10207,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She seems to be suffering from shortness of breath, &quot;hyperventilating&quot;!  She forgot to mention that modeling is a cruel profession.  Once a model turns 25, she is considered old.  Most &quot;retire&quot; before age 30.  Also, for someone who was used to getting by on their good looks, AGING can be a horrific experience!  Most normal, average-looking people develop social skills that help them throughout their entire lives.  &quot;Pretty people&quot; are used to getting their way, simply because of how they look, once they lose their looks, they do not know how to deal with it!  (e.g. Angie Dickinson, Bridget Nielson, . . . )",1
10208,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron Russell, you are as beautiful inside as you are outside. Great presentation. ",1
10209,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Love this talk!,1
10210,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Drinking game: every time she say &quot;um&quot; take a drink. :/,1
10211,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"says the woman who had to spend time to look good for her presentation, oh wait...",1
10212,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but no one falls in love with your personality at first sight right?,1
10213,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,beeing fat and beeing too skinny is unnatural. The models I see mostly in magazin etc. have beautiful skin/hair/face but their body propotions are really unattractiv. It looks like they are suffreing with those legs and arms. Don&#39;t understand the attraction to women of this kind. I think that men with a body like Arnold are not beautiful neither. His body is nice to look at and a bit impressiv but it is just too extreme and not beautiful(one of my favourite actors though)<br>I don&#39;t have empathy with girls saying &quot;I want to be skinny like a model&quot; because they would deserve their suffring if they are not able to figure out that this ideal is dumb.<br><br>Somebody thinks these girls are beautiful pls comment.,1
10214,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,nuts,1
10215,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Well if I was prettier my crush would at least notice me,1
10216,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,bullsht,1
10217,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I have said &quot;sorry officer&quot; 4 times in my life and I was let go each time and Iam not a model!,1

10219,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"24 percent non white, gunna stop you right there. The population of the US is majority white 77 percent to be exact. So don&#39;t try to make this a race thing, for instance you wouldn&#39;t have 50 percent black models and 50 percent Hispanic models in Africa simply because there was a 13 percent hispanic population which is the case with black Americans in the US.",1
10220,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why do people act like these ted talks are so intelligent? I didn&#39;t learn anything new. Yeah, a hairstylist does the model&#39;s hair, &amp; someone retouches the photos.",1
10221,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;looks arent everything&quot; something only pretty people say<br>it&#39;s like when rich people tell you money cant buy happiness, no it cant but it&#39;s sure hard to be sad on a jet ski",1

10224,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Easy af to say this when you have looks tho lmao,1
10225,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks may not be everything but I&#39;d rather be a hot supermodel and unhappy than ugly working a 9-5 and unhappy lmao,1
10226,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I can attest to life being easier when you&#39;re intelligent and attractive. Unfortunately, being socially retarded negates a lot of those benefits. :)",1
10227,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Your an inspiration,1
10228,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In the beginning, she&#39;s saying looks aren&#39;t everything, yet  She legit contradicted her own argument.. Her changing from beautiful to a more &quot;lazier&quot; outfit is only proving that looks are everything.",1
10229,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is so honest and great,i hope there will be more humans like her though i do not have high hopes.",1
10230,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This model isn&#39;t dumb and unaware she is aware of the privileges she has and continues to accept them,1
10231,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,LOL Im not for stereotypes but this talk was out of focus. get to the point. because it wasn&#39;t clear to me.,1
10232,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Of course, LOOKS make everything way much better :3 people treat you differently according to how you looks :(",1
10233,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"having a face like that in a world like this is like an invite to being pestered by the jehovah witnesses of ugliness who want you to believe, like they do, that you can&#39;t be smart and good looking. and you&#39;d be surprised how many ugly people there are even if they don&#39;t appear that way. just reading the disgusting assumptions made about her disclosing that she got away with speeding, might help you empathize with her. imagine having to weigh everything you say based on what the listener is most likely to precieve and just so they don&#39;t get any wrong ideas.Now try to be a hundred times more cautious than that and see how you like it.",1
10234,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So... your complaining about being gorgeous?...lady, Id rather be good looking and stupid than ugly and smart...  the &quot;pretty&quot; people get pretty much what they want. try being ugly for a day and see how many men pay attention to you then. And if your a man the only way your getting the attention of a pretty woman is to either be rich or to be good looking, the best bet is to be both.",1
10235,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,anyone else seeing the irony here..,1
10236,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,All the ugly &amp; bitter people in the comment section just because they don&#39;t understand the ACTUAL message.,1
10237,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything...not much of a revelation there.,1
10238,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this speech has no main idea... it is all over the plac...,1
10239,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"people hating in the comments: yes, she&#39;s pointing out all these things but she is still a model because like she already stated, that&#39;s how society views her. and don&#39;t get into that mumbo jumbo about how &quot;you can change what people think of you if you try&quot; unless you are willing to put yourself in the same shoes and see how difficult it would be for you if  everyone viewed you in a certain way and you constantly had to prove you aren&#39;t like that. sometimes it seems much smarter to play on other peoples&#39; ignorance and shallow thoughts of you. and telling of peoples&#39; intelligence here is that many seem to  think it is impossible to be shallow when you&#39;re not gifted in the looks department. no darling, it&#39;s not exclusive. had she gotten a degree she still wouldn&#39;t have been taken seriously, mostly due to her gender and looks. she would have to work twice as hard for her professional opinion to count and she&#39;d probably need a phd for the fog infront of your eyes to clear and finally see her as an equal.",1
10240,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;ve never seen such a heated up yet decently intelligent comment section. Wow,1
10241,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok, so looks are important, that&#39;s just a fact. When getting a job and believe it or not even getting a partner because of FIRST IMPRESSIONS unless he date is blind but they aren&#39;t everything and she&#39;s saying material things can&#39;t replace emotions",1
10242,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this is amazing. wow.,1
10243,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"everyone has insecurities. everyones struggle, life &amp; pain is real. it isn&#39;t measurable or a competition and it should never ever have been.",1
10244,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"okay, beauty isn&#39;t everything but it does a lot.",1
10245,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she sounds nervous,1
10246,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I can&#39;t think of a time that this would be more important than it is right now. with all these social media stars and models coming out of the wood work this is so so so extremely important for people to hear. Glad I stumbled upon this.,1
10247,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s FUCKIN wrong LOOKS ARE EVERYTHING.. no women or man goggles over the other without an instant FUCKIN ATTRACTION,1
10248,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,it&#39;s kind of hard to get her point because she is good looking. But she&#39;s right,1
10249,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks r the gateway to anything, and your smarts are what backs you up",1
10250,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not only are those photos not you, but your body isn&#39;t you either. Studies have shown that we are surprisingly unattached to our physical form. This is just a small point in a very long chain of indicators that there is a clear divide between our true selves and the part of us that is governed by our material existence. Every which way you turn, you will find that your material existence comes into conflict with your true self (consciousness, spirit or whatever obscure label you choose to use). You will find that despite Belinda Carlisle&#39;s catchy appeal, heaven actually isn&#39;t a place on earth.<br><br>What I&#39;m getting at is that it would be beneficial to keep the two spheres separated intellectually, because they don&#39;t really go together. They&#39;re like oil and water and trying to mix them generates nothing but confusion. For example, you may know in your heart that our selection processes are superficial, but despite your conviction you will be helpless in overcoming them, even personally. I think you should absolutely fight for a better world. But once you realize and accept that there are boundaries there that cannot be dissolved, everything will make a lot more sense.",1
10251,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was remarkably candid.,1
10252,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I get this it&#39;s so sad. I&#39;ve also been a model / nurse / banking customer service specialist and I enjoy feeling good about myself and taking care of my healthy, body &amp; emotions as much as I can. I don&#39;t get any attention from men, in fact I&#39;ve had a few dangerous experiences. It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve had a conversation with a male who I don&#39;t know. I seem to be ignored and I&#39;ve been through a huge phase of being bullied, excluded and gossiped about by men and women and it&#39;s affected my confidence greatly. I believe confidence and positive support from family and friends is important in life. Looking attractive doesn&#39;t mean you will  get ahead more, which studies show is true but for me it was not. I am working on self love, raising my vibration to positivity to hopefully manifest positive outcomes in my life and achieve my goals with careful planning and monitoring. I was very unhappy for a long time and it&#39;s because I had no confidence. That is the key! I loved your talk!!!!!",1
10253,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"if a model is talking about how looks arent everything, can i be an electrical engineet and say that electricity is actually just magic pixie dust?",1
10254,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,so true what she is saying looks arnt everything an stupid ppl follow looks,1
10255,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How to get people to like you:<br>1. Don&#39;t be ugly,1
10256,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"damn ! ladies you got me there , what a  great heart and soul",1
10257,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i just came here to see what models sound like,1
10258,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she is so real, honest and ... and ... a normal human being, no credit for that but then its worth appreciation because most live projections of what they assume to be impressive. And she doesnt seem to try to impress. Good on her.",1
10259,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Overall pointless presentation. Too cliche without much if any elaboration on her &quot;point,&quot; which was what, looks don&#39;t matter because she&#39;s unhappy? Absolutely riveting. Next.",1
10260,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow I could listen to her all day,1
10261,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I liked many of the points she made, but she didn&#39;t really tie it into any succinct point/s she was trying to make. It felt like a lot of it was implied or open to interpretation. So many great things to say, and wonderful arguments, it just needed a bit more structure.",1

10272,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s very sad that this videos meaning will be quite misconstrued. I commend her for actually owning up to how her privilege has benefitted her and being willing enough to tell other white people that their privilege hurts and oppresses other people deeply and it is time to put an end to it. She made a great talk about racism, sexism, bias, perception and gender roles in about 10 min.",1

It was also nice to see that she sounds funny and cool and does some self reflection. Also, what she said about feeling insecure about herself  makes perfect sense because if you know growing up that most of your worth is based on your look, you will obsess over it at all times and panic as you get older and your appearance deteriorates and other younger girls come along to take your spot.",1

She never denied this and stays very factual about her privileges in comparison to those that don&#39;t have the same privilege as they don&#39;t fit the discription box. Being pretty paid her all the way to college but she wants to acomplish more in life then her looks and this Ted Talk was a part of it. Her insta is also very activist orientated and I applaud her for that. <br><br>She has substance and we are now left with a generation of instagram teens that think everything that glitters turns into gold.

10305,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you are talented and creative and can paint pictures that are good enough to be viewed and then sold in an art gallery you DON&#39;T NEED LOOKS. If you have the talent to compose, write and sing songs then you     DON&#39;T NEED LOOKS. If your cooking is so good and your dishes are so tasty then you might be able to earn big money as a chef - NOBODY CARES WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.",1
10306,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lol. No one approaches me at school because of the way i look. I get hurtful comments all the time. I have 1 best friend and it took me 13 years to have one. So yeah... i guess looks dont matter,1
10307,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Trust me, I&#39;m a model?",1
10308,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m handsome I&#39;m happy,1
10309,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Oh you poor thing!,1
10310,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I got a Melanie Martinez ad before this... also, great message",1
10311,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Amazing,1
10312,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,no entend nadaa...,1
10313,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sure, beauty isn&#39;t everything; BUT it sure helps.",1
10314,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What this TED Talks says to me and what I believe she meant to convey needs more than 10 minutes. This woman&#39;s talk can&#39;t be summarized as &quot;looks don&#39;t matter&quot; or &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything.&quot; She acknowledges her own privilege and how much her life was determined by her looks. She says in her last few minutes that she is uncomfortable about her benefitting from a system that uses oppression and prejudice. Many might see this as condescending or superficial but this woman appears to be very honest about her profession and status in life. I wonder how she will explain this to her daughter if her daughter does not receive all the same model genes as her. What if her daughter is 5&#39; 5&quot; or not the model figure?,1
10315,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"you are brave to stand and talk about your experience, I wouldn&#39;t expect to hear deep touching talk from a model. Thank you",1
10316,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,would smash,1
10317,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,now that her career is over and everyones running for the next young thing....,1
10318,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Comments make it clear that no one actually listened to her speech lol,1
10319,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So beautiful....,1
10320,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Im not beautiful and I agree with her, looks arent averything.",1
10321,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everything isn&#39;t everything,1
10322,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s ridiculous how male beauty standards are completely overlooked when it&#39;s becoming as much of a problem in today&#39;s society.,1
10323,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hello  there .. ground I really please   this vid jeavioy  legacy  !!,1
10324,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She says looks aren&#39;t everything because she&#39;s satisfied with her look.,1
10325,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Cameron Russell! You inspire me a lot. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it &lt;3,1
10326,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,so you agree? you think you look really pretty?,1
10327,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She KNOWS that looks matter in society but she&#39;s saying looks DON&#39;T REALLY matter which she&#39;s trying to convey by sharing some personal facts and her own experience!!!!!! Hows that so hard to understand?!!!!!,1
10328,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why&#39;d she have to make it a racial,1
10329,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Pretty wife is just for 3 years. But ugly wife is for forever. 3 years enough.,1
10330,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am a white 14 year old but with tan skin. I&#39;m skinny. I get told a lot that I should model. I have gotten told that by a very beautiful person, who I admire. I know every person ia beautiful but I hope you understand what I meant there. It sure does feel nice to hear compliments etc. I have gotten free keyrings for my beadwork for free. I know that&#39;s not much and it could just be because I was like 10 years old then and they don&#39;t want a kid spending their money like this but still. <br>Looks help with first impressions, they can make someone more interested in your personality. I am insecure about my body. My skin has light coloured dots everywhere (not freckles) and my ears face forward and my hair is frizzy and curly. Those are my biggest insecurities. I have them too. I wish I had a better personality. I am very sarcastic and quite rude. I wish I was that kind person who people look up to. I guess I have become more assertive (which is a good thing) so I can stand up for myself more now but I should be more kind",1
10331,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"so basically, everyone has their own problems? good point",1
10332,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s great :D,1
10333,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks might not be EVERYTHING, but it still is ALOT of things. Trust me.",1
10334,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything because she&#39;s got it.,1
10335,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Everyone preaches it, but there are rare people who actually practice !! Hats off to you for your boldness over the matter (y)",1
10336,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks matter, she was trying to say it shouldn&#39;t matter... trying to tell you that even though models are so beautiful, they are the most insecure.... thats why I love my hijab honestly. I am not judging anyone on how they dress or whatever, but I just wanted to sayI&#39;ve never felt more confident than when I started wearing hijab and not caring about how others see me. I feel like im protecting something beautiful and valuable, which is my physical appearance and my dignity and honor. These poor modelsare usually only valued for their appearance, I rly hope they can find true freedom.I don&#39;t need anyones approval, I know I am beautiful the way God made me. I really loved this womans speech, its full of truth.",1
10337,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t believe she was saying looks don&#39;t matter as to how they affect your things around you, she seems to reluctantly acknowledge that they of course do, but at the end of the day, they do not correlate to being more happy. Which, should be all of our true goals in life.",1
10338,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s not even pretty or white...,1
10339,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful truth. &lt;3&lt;3,1
10340,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wish there were more honest and smart people like her,1
10341,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I thought this was about looks not being important but of course its more white guilt bs,1
10342,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks unfortunately are everything... To get the job that you want, the boyfriend or girlfriend you want, even friends. Beauty counts... big time",1
10343,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,a strong message from someone sitting comfortably in the good looks zone where life is much easier than when your ugly.,1
10344,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,if she married ugly guy it would really be convincing,1
10345,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Is there a part 2?,1
10346,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good joke, looks are everything, people want to know your character only when the first &quot;gate&quot; is open. This gate is your look, so many people with a great personality arent able to share it with the people they want, because their &quot;first gate&quot; never opens. The problem is, in order to develop a great personality, you probably need to have some friends and so on and also kind of a motivation. All these things are aquired easier when you look good, because you simply wake up in the morning and see yourself in the mirror and get somewhat of a &quot;kick&quot; for your motivation. Luckily there is something like &quot;taste&quot; in our world so you might be attractive to some people simply because their brain tells them so even though most people wouldnt find you attractive. But sadly there is almost no hope if you are mega ugly.",1
10347,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beauty wiy brain.,1
10348,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,great speech but I hope she is not a lesbian,1
10349,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,To me she is beautiful inside and out and I respect that she spoke her truth. Thanks TEDx for the great variety speakers and topics !,1
10350,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,jim jefferies taught me otherwise.,1
10351,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This video and title make no sense. A complete waste of time watching it. Nothing new, everyone know good looks are just a matter of luck that you are born with ! Dint need to hear that from a model. ",1
10352,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Whoever thinks looks don&#39;t matter are flattering themselves. The way you look has an influence everywhere from your personal life to your professional life. If you aren&#39;t good looking people might not take you very seriously (I speak from personal experience). You always have a low self esteem. Combine that with being overweight (not even obese) you get to be the butt of all jokes until that one day when you put your foot down. I know being fat isn&#39;t healthy but there is no need for people to rub it in every time they see me. I am more than what I look but people will never realize that.,1
10353,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything does not equal looks don&#39;t matter. Actually, she gave multiple instances where looks mattered. However, that does not guarantee happiness. A blessing can become a curse depending on your mindset. Since models are pretty (because of genetics and legacy as she puts it), they get offered a lot for just so that their looks can be exploited. However, since everything in their life is centered around that, they also get super self-conscious about those very looks which can lead to low self esteem, stress, etc.",1
10354,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Looks arent important&quot; says someone whos probably never really worried about how she looks,1
10355,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m a civil engineering student. I&#39;m pretty sure I land every internship primarily because of the way I look and my intelligence comes second. This is fucking degrading. I&#39;m constantly filing sexual harassment claims. It&#39;s crazy to think that all of this happens because we &quot;fit&quot; society&#39;s standards of beauty.,1
10356,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very interesting!,1
10357,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Love love love the message behind this video:)!!!!,1
10358,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are everything, believe me I&#39;m ugly!",1
10359,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am skinny, I have shiny hair, and I am tall but I am still ugly. I cannot point it out but something on my face is not normal",1
10360,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,the thing is she is gorgeous no matter what she wears :/,1
10361,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s true. Looks will get you so far.. until you will be called to use your inner beauty and brains to get through life and built meaningful relationships. If material life is what drives you, than image will be your best mechanism. However, if you want to get the most out of life , it will take more than a pretty face and a skinny body .",1
10362,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"shez just a tall white gurl...whats so exceptionally beautiful  about her ! she&#39;s attractive yes, but exceptional beauty, i dont think so...",1
10363,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Normally ted talks make me feel better. But this one maybe feel worse.,1
10364,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks arent everything but its the first thing people see,1
10365,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow, it seems like a lot of people missed the point of this video",1
10366,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Don&#39;t trust pretty people, trust me I&#39;m a model.&quot;",1
10367,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,people got eyes so looks matter but from inner heart it doesn&#39;t matter. I agreed with her,1
10368,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,nothing substantial,1
10369,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,such a great talk ,1
10370,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,MODELS are the most INSECURE PEOPLE for they have to be SELF CONSCIOUS all the damn TIME.  LIKE IF YOU AGREE,1
10371,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is a lottle bit egocentric, she is not as pretty as she thinks following general actual opinion of  what is beautiful or sexy.",1
10372,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;people paying a cost for how they look and not for who they are&quot; omG,1
10373,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Amazing woman, thank you.",1

10375,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Legacy. What is a legacy?&quot; A. Ham,1
10376,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Just by looking at the title... I think I&#39;ll pass.,1
10377,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is the best video I have ever seen. Congrats who ever wrote the text, it is so true on so many levels. More!",1
10378,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,youre a model...you earn from looks. thats what models do isnt it?,1
10379,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A really fine talk.,1
10380,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But the thing is being fat and ugly also makes me insecure. I mean, at least when you are a model you won&#39;t hear people saying &quot;hey, you&#39;re fat.&quot; or like &quot;hey, fatty !&quot; or...other stuffs. So it&#39;s not strange that I too would wish I&#39;m skinnier and more beautiful. Maybe I am wishing to trade one unhappiness with another, but still...I wish I could look like a model ( not become one though )",1
10381,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It is our own mental attitude which makes the world what it is for us. Our thoughts make things beautiful, our thoughts make things ugly. The whole world is in our own minds.  Krishna, Lectures, Volume 1<br><br><br>Karma-Yoga tells us to enjoy the beauty of all the pictures in the world, but not to identify ourselves with any of them. Never say &quot;mine&quot;. Whenever we say a thing is &quot;mine&quot;, misery will immediately come. Do not even say &quot;my child&quot; in your mind. Possess the child, but do not say &quot;mine&quot;. If you do, then will come the misery.  Freedom, Karma Yoga, Volume 1<br><br><br>To him who desires nothing, and does not mix himself up with them, the manifold changes of nature are one panorama of beauty and sublimity.

10383,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"...Substance...that&#39;s what she has. That&#39;s when her TRUE BEAUTY SHINES! This Ted talk is so relevant and important. To all the men saying that this talk is &quot;pointless&quot; or a &quot;waste of time&quot;. Think about your wife and children...this is important to them and impacts millions of people year round. We have to have these conversations to mantain our sense of reality and reshape the minds of our youth. The Emotional, Physical, and Mental effects of Consumerism are devastating.",1
10384,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great talk.,1
10385,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,myeah... meaningless talk,1
10386,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;what is a legacy&quot; Well Cameron, its planting seeds in a garden you never get to see...",1
10387,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very nice talk ,1
10388,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s useless to tell people that looks don&#39;t matter because the truth is, they do. Looks don&#39;t mean happiness and success and wealth and fame  but having good looks gives you a higher chance of reaching those. people who are rich say that being rich brings along problems, but anyone would rather have rich people problems than poor people problems, same goes for good looks. Obviously the message she&#39;s trying to pass is positive, but its pointless.",1
10389,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No matter where I see it, this talk is inspiring. That is coming from the mind of a 17-yr-old female, who grew up in this touched-up, superficial but nonetheless wonderful world",1
10390,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she is a beautiful human being ,1
10391,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is not even pretty !!,1
10392,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Bringing up racial privilege... Well, as to her first point that only 4% of models in America are non-white, that&#39;s probably because we are a predominantly white country. This works on multiple levels, the first being that people are far more likely to be attracted to someone of their own race than of another, and the second is that of all the white people here only 4% of those won this genetic lottery to be a model, and lets say that comes out to an even 200 women (yes I know that number isn&#39;t even in the ballpark, but for the sake of argument lets say it is), so then only 4% of black people win that same genetic lottery that would only come out to about 5 (again for the sake of argument). Blacks are a minority for a reason, and they make up an incredibly small portion of the population, so it only makes sense to have a number of models proportionate to that number. Then she threw in some example about getting pulled over... For some reason...",1
10393,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i havent watched the video and I&#39;m not going to but someone whos hot asf wont have a problem with their looks as much as an ugly person would so dont say looks dont matter. just because u dont have the problems of being ugly doesn&#39;t mean other people dont,1
10394,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,talks talks talks,1
10395,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,sadly in reality people with &quot;good looking&quot; get much more benefit than the not good looking one,1
10396,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I wish a dude could give a talk on how looks so don&#39;t matter, that would be interesting..",1
10397,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel fabulous after watching this,1
10398,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A woman must be a cute, cuddly, naive little thing - tender, sweet, and stupid. - Laci Green",1
10399,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The best advice I can give to men is <b>raise your standards</b>. Find someone who is as beautiful on the inside as on the outside. Don&#39;t settle for a woman who doesn&#39;t respect you or believes that &quot;men are bad&quot; or that men cause all of the problems in the world. Just move on to a woman who has more character and empathy.,1
10400,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Best Ted Talk i&#39;ve ever saw !,1
10401,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Paradox,1
10402,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The real problems comes when your are ugly outside, and even uglier inside. Selfish, disrespectful, lier... it makes you the ugliest.",1
10403,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol looks are everything... yes you can be beautiful with a method of having plastic surgery?? whatever it is but you need to agreed on this one,1
10404,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Her being beautiful ENTITLES her to saying what looks are and aren&#39;t. People who are ugly (by societal norms) can&#39;t really know how they&#39;d feel if they were pretty. That&#39;s the whole point, we get the bigger picture from a model&#39;s perspective of how being pretty isn&#39;t everything, and that while it is beneficial, people shouldn&#39;t make beauty a lifestyle.",1
10405,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"looks arent everything, but body odor is?",1
10406,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wish this talk is conducted by woman that is really judged as not good looking by society and how she achieve happiness and success. Not from an already  good looking girl,1
10407,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But I believe that at least looks play a part into achieving happiness. They get away with stuffs easily, and everything could work in their favor by using that advantage. So girls with good looks, they should feel its easier to be content with their life. Ugly girls doesnt get any of that. Who likes ugly stuffs anyway",1
10408,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Look, anybody can be genetically physically attractive if they know how to dress and how to cut their hair and such. Don&#39;t think you&#39;re hopeless in the looks department. And stop not taking people like her seriously just because you want something they have; just because you want something it doesn&#39;t make that thing perfect, there&#39;s downsides to everything",1
10409,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,u r prefect <br>i hope to see u in my life or my dream<br>  but i havent idia to talk with u,1
10410,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yep not everything, just ALMOST",1
10411,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Believe me, I&#39;m a model.&quot; And therein lies the contradiction.",1
10412,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Seems like she cares but then she is still feeding and working in a industry and pushes the percentages up of the 78% of girls who hate their bodies by the time they are 17. Okay.,1
10413,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,STAY WOKE,1
10414,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why are Ted talks such a joke these days,1
10415,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"looks arent everything but close. the features that are found to be classically attractive like height, hip to waist ratio, breast size, facial and body symmetry, are indicators of being healthy and having a healthy immune system and having high fertility. simply pretty people are pretty because nearly all biology is based on selective breeding. we are also biologically inclined to be nicer or to take commands from pretty people because we think it improves breeding chances. its the social construct that we have made that allows us to overcome those biological cues",1
10416,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Love her talk. Very honest. I commend her on touching on things that most people don&#39;t want  to hear.,1
10417,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think with enough work almost anyone can make themselves good looking. So even if it does matter a lot, anyone can be beautiful.",1
10418,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but then first lady is a supermodel tho!!,1
10419,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she acts like white people get handed everything. Even stuff. Well I&#39;m white. never been handed anything. or given anything for free at the store. In fact we&#39;ve had to put stuff back cuz we didn&#39;t have the money,1
10420,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"so much respect for her now,",1

10422,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think the thing that you should take from this talk is that happiness is a feeling that you have or not, and not a thing that you can posses.",1
10423,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Models really are dumb. &quot;Uh huh heh uhm hahi&quot;,1
10424,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wot is beauty ?wot is happiness ? wot is achievement? wot is success?  well ,for most of us those are the things which is society \ media telling to us.. lets not be a blind follower..",1

10435,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Amazing speech ! I don&#39;t think she wanted to said &quot;Look doesn&#39;t matter&quot; but to not think that models are the most lucky and perfect because :<br>-They are not the person you see in magazine<br>-They work  hard to be an illusion of perfection<br>-They aren&#39;t the most happy,1
10436,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are very important. It&#39;s an instinct (for men especially) to be with someone who looks good. This is because people want to pass down GOOD traits not ugly ones.,1

10452,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fascinating.,1
10453,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ironically her face reminds me of Cameron from &quot;House&quot;,1
10454,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,good thing im just a happy potatoe,1
10455,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything....She just told us she got everything from her looks. Free is free that.,1
10456,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"title: looks aren&#39;t everything.<br>content: my looks got me everything and it&#39;s just not fair for you ugly people.<br><br>OK haha I was hoping to feel better after this, not worse.",1
10457,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s not completely related to this topic but I want to say it: <b>FEEL</b> beautiful and attractive make you happy and self-confident, even if you&#39;re not so handsome! You just have to believe in it <br>Feel sorry for yourself doesn&#39;t change nothing ;)",1
10458,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m a little confused what the real message was.. but doesn&#39;t matter because she&#39;s pretty. It was a great presentation!,1
10459,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,testing 1 2 3,1
10460,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good looks will no doubt impress others quicker, but who u really are is the only key to build more sincere and deeper relationships",1
10461,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lies.,1
10462,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she didn&#39;t transform my impression of her at all,1
10463,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s so beautiful !! not because how she looks but because how smart and honest she is. i&#39;m in love,1
10464,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,XOX,1
10465,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But it&#39;s true about insecurity...,1
10466,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really like this talk and I think people should stop hating,1
10467,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Melania Trump is now our first lady. Underwear models can be anything they put their arched back in to.,1
10468,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;LOOK AT ALL THESE PICTURES OF HOW HOT I AM <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BLESSED"">#BLESSED</a>.&quot;<br><br>Great talk.",1
10469,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything&quot;. Easy for a model to say. It&#39;s exactly like Donald Trump saying that money doesn&#39;t matter.,1
10470,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great presentation on female privilege.,1
10471,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"looks are everything, money is everything. trust me you will be happy with both the above more than not having both",1
10472,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree with her, looks do shape people&#39;s perspective of someone else. Is it fair? Is it natural? Could it be possible that it isn&#39;t fair and it&#39;s  a natural process for our brains. Also, I think people should always keep in mind that those model pictures are superficial.",1
10473,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I clicked on this so fast,1
10474,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I hate to say it, but looks do in fact make up a big part of what makes someone attractive. If I met the funniest, nicest, and most caring girl ever, but she wasn&#39;t very good looking, I&#39;d be friends with her, but probably no more than that. On the flip side of that, if I met a super attractive girl, but she didn&#39;t have a very nice personality, I probably wouldn&#39;t want to hang out with her. I will admit, looks aren&#39;t EVERYTHING, but they do play a damn large role. Now I do believe that if you love someone&#39;s personality enough, then over time you will find them more and more attractive. <br>However, even if someone is damn hot, that doesn&#39;t always guarantee them a date. I, myself, would be considered a good looking man. I have a strong jawline, nice hair, blue eyes, and well toned skin. However, I have no idea how to get girls to be any more than just friends with me. I&#39;m super awkward, and fairly wacky. I also don&#39;t have a lot of experience with girls. So anybody out there who is down because they think they&#39;re ugly, just remember that good looks aren&#39;t all you need.",1
10475,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;looks arent everything&quot;....the phrase that is said by only 2 types of people<br><br>1) good looking people who are too nice to say that looks dont matter due to people possibly taking offense to it<br>2) ugly people,1
10476,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,  ?   !       ?,1
10477,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,someone put acid on her face,1
10478,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lol , looks ARE everything , looks give you power ,a special kind of power , the power of pre-selection and that is really valuable",1
10479,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why am I here, I don&#39;t care if looks don&#39;t matter, I have a project to do!",1
10480,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It realy confused me as a German guy that I read in german &quot;lust auf Sommer&quot; and first I had to think about what it means.,1
10481,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,10 min of useless and bullshit talk,1
10482,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but she  is  avarage,1
10483,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fat people cant be models,1
10484,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People keep saying I look ugly because they want someone to tell them  they don&#39;t<br><br><br>So let me tell you something<br>There is no such thing as &quot;Hot or Ugly&quot; cause its all about taste,1
10485,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol shes not even that good. looks like she might even have a willy.,1
10486,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This girl is far from &quot;sexy&quot;.,1
10487,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She doesn&#39;t look as good as she thinks she does, but respect for trying to convey a beautiful message.",1
10488,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wonder if me and her are related o_O,1
10489,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"next up: Money isn&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a billionaire. | Donald J. Trump",1
10490,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That is incredible,1
10491,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This girl is gorgeous in whatever she wears  sorry love. But it&#39;s true.,1
10492,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she said kings bridge nyc??,1
10493,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"looks are everything, believe me ... i&#39;m a freak.",1
10494,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Easy for you to say....you&#39;re a model!,1
10495,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,10/10 would bang Cameron Russell,1
10496,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,oxymoron. how would she know. shes a model duhhh,1
10497,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks do matter,in a way.",1
10498,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok, nothing against her but this talk was all over the place. She had a bit too many topics for a talk this short I guess.",1
10499,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i wish we were all beautiful,1
10500,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes but the wrld judge us so......so u can&#39;t tell or make thm understood that it don&#39;t matter......and the is dilemma,1
10501,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes but the wrld judge us so......so u can&#39;t tell or make thm understood that it don&#39;t matter......and the is dilemma,1
10502,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Most of these comments are really scary and disturbing to read. Mainly because many have been written by people straining to/incapable of exercising critical thought.,1
10503,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I really liked what she said, but I feel like there was an idea that she didn&#39;t manage to bring out properly which made it sound incomplete. Nonetheless, it was a nice presentation =)",1
10504,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she changed my perspective, at first I thought, how can you make me see u as a average person, but by the end I found her very relatable, real, and honest. thanks",1
10505,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what an amazing TED talk.,1
10506,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She has nothing to avoid talking about. What a fucking life these people are living!!!,1
10507,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ew,1
10508,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not even watched the video but this is fucking stupid. She has absolutely no idea what it&#39;s like to be ugly af so what value does her opinion  on this matter actually have? <br><br>Oh that&#39;s right. Absolutely zero.,1
10509,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,marry me then,1
10510,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,really? REALLY? She is a model AND is bitching about it?,1
10511,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Problem is that initial reaction of typical man comes from the fact that whatever you say, he hears: Hi, I am [pretty] and I am not your league..... and that reaction tends to be negative....",1
10512,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She doesn&#39;t properly tell the unimportance of looks. See you really have to work your butt off in order to achieve something(mainly career). So whatever profession you choose, you&#39;ve put in your best. If she decided to be a model, then it&#39;s obvious she&#39;d be paid for her looks which means, for her the looks should be her priority because they earn her a living. And next she says, she isn&#39;t happy in her life, like she appears in the photographs. I couldn&#39;t understand why she mixes these two things. If she&#39;s going well with her career, it&#39;s no necessary that she&#39;s getting well in her personal life too.",1
10513,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t understand a thing<br>... maybe because she is so beautiful that I paid more attention to her looks than to her words.,1
10514,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok. I am an attractive tall girl (who by the way has been spotted a few times - never went to the agencies) and while I enjoy being attractive, I often find that my inner self doesnt match my outer. I feel like people and guys often treat me with a little unease and admiration that dont match how I feel on the inside: shy and insecure. So while I experience the world being uneasy and insecure, people from the outside see something different. I wish that this difference would be smaller...",1
10515,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"More, this needed to be longer",1
10516,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for sharing this! Very important.,1
10517,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks are the most important thing for romance. Don&#39;t let anyone fool you. A good personality doesn&#39;t get anyone aroused.,1
10518,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If looks aren&#39;t everything, why don&#39;t you knock out your two front teeth then?",1
10519,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I only feel bad for her because she&#39;s hot,1
10520,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She seems cool,1
10521,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Soo.. you get everything handed to you for free because you were handed the genetic lottery and are super hot, but looks don&#39;t matter?",1
10522,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but money does matter,1
10523,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is nice... <br><br>Look at the comments... <br><br>Everyone is getting along... <br>Thats what i love about YouTube... <br><br>Theres always a video to bond a couple billion people...,1
10524,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful and honest ,1
10525,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If somebody is fat and poor, people say &quot;don&#39;t whine, you big lazy cow, and do something with your life&quot;. <br><br>Then, when a pretty rich girl complains about not being 100% happy despite her &quot;genetic lottery winnings&quot;, people are like &quot;Oh, how wise. Poor thing...but such a kind spirit&quot;. Its truly ridiculous. You&#39;ve stripped the unsuccessful of this world even of the right to complain, and you give <b>that</b> now to the lucky ones, too. What remains to those who aren&#39;t lucky then?",1
10526,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are important because we have eyes.,1
10527,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Mmmm I don&#39;t know man. I didn&#39;t find her to be that good looking. Insecurity is unattractive. She looks fairly good, but in the end it has to do with taking care of your looks. Anyone can look good at that point. Rly. Lack of belief is a big part of it all. She really believes in how she looks and have gotten approval for it due to her career. <br><br>Perception is reality. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard that one before. If you perceive that you are good looking, you will start acting how a good looking person acts, and you will begin to be percieved as being good looking. It&#39;s actually pretty simple. What is not so simple however, is how our communication works. You should know that only around 20 % of our communication is verbal - what we say. The rest comes down to first and foremost, body language and there after, tonality. This is how we communicate good looks. Especially as guys, but also as girls. <br><br>Of course there are also some natural factors to the whole thing, but you can definitely be good looking, no matter what. I bet some of you reading this will have some doubts and I only have one thing to say to that. That is your problem. Your doubt creates uncertainty, which in turn will create unnatural movement patterns and a whole bunch of unattractive communication. Therefore people perceive you as unnattractive. Beauty is a wonderful thing if you know how to create it.",1
10528,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I hate genetic lottery winnersandpeople born into money.,1
10529,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this was he first talk probably. right?,1
10530,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hello, every day I play something fun.",1
10531,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes brains are very sexy, too bad you have none.",1
10532,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The title is so annoying almost offending &quot;Believe me&quot; it&#39;s like she is sure that everybody else thinks that looks are everything.,1
10533,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"talk about beating a dead horse comment section, god damn the woman is already beating herself, she doesn&#39;t need your help",1
10534,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything, but they&#39;re a big part of it. I wouldn&#39;t want to date someone with a good personality but bad looks, or someone with good looks and a bad personality. I want someone I&#39;m attracted to both ways.",1
10535,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she sounded so nervous, i think she did a great job and thank you",1
10536,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,oh no.<br><br><br>this is the video they showed at my school.,1
10537,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In just 33 seconds people decide 4 things about you:  Who you are, what you do for a living, how much money you make &amp; whether or not they should respect you.  First impressions are hard to break.   Unfortunately folks do tell a book by its cover.  So make that first impression a good one.",1
10538,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What is the point here?,1
10539,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t understand the point of this talk.,1
10540,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Even after the outfit change she is still hot.,1
10541,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i wish the talk was more longer. it has a real and heartfelt message,1
10542,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I feel like she failed to address the negatives about physical beauty. I also felt like she was too politically correct and did not uncover the &quot;truth.&quot;  I don&#39;t believe the media has that much power over the world&#39;s definition of physical beauty. For example, if the media chose to ONLY show models who were overweight, I don&#39;t think society would start to view overweight as physically beautiful.",1
10543,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,feminist feel good platitude puff piece,1
10544,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well, she could always chose a different career, she chose the EASY way. :) No respect for her there.",1
10545,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This talk has no point.,1
10546,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If looks don&#39;t matter, then why do prettier people get better jobs easier? Oh right, because looks DO matter.",1
10547,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In the words of Judge Judy, &quot;beauty fades, dumb is forever.&quot;",1
10548,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,At 30 Years Old EVERY WOMAN HIS THE WALL.  MODELS must milk each day prior.  <br><br>VOTE TRUMP 2016!!!,1
10549,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks ARE everything! Ever heard Dave Beckham speak? It&#39;s like he mouth-sexed a can of helium,1
10550,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,being ugly isnt everything believe me im ugly,1
10551,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Huh. I actually expected much more idiotic vitriol down here in the comments.<br>Color me impressed.,1
10552,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I can&#39;t believe some of the comments here!!? She is NOT saying &quot;looks don&#39;t matter&quot;....or anything of that nature!<br>She is saying that as somebody who inherited good looks and made a career based on that, it doesn&#39;t mean that her life is always fabulous or that she is constantly happy and self contented. In fact she is MORE insecure than the average person because she knows she only has a career because of how she looks, not because she did anything to deserve it.",1
10553,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she feels guilty that she is a beneficiary of gender and racial oppression?   roflmao<br><br>so she uses her TED talk to offload her mental illness onto everyone else<br><br>get off the stage you moron,1
10554,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;d stick it up her butt,1
10555,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is an amazing talk. She makes so much sense. I wish her all the happiness in the life. I am inspired by this talk. Corporations and their tactics have made us believe something that is a hoax. I wish everybody gets to do what they really want to do in life and be happy.,1
10556,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Play at 1.5x playback speed.  ;)<br>You&#39;re welcome.,1
10557,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why is the title in Japanese ?,1

I dated a singer, she was freaking beautiful and gorgeous on the outside, once she took her clothes off, forget about it, also she had a bad attitude.",1

10578,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,how do i get a model?,1
10579,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is an odd talk. The title says that looks don&#39;t matter but she is saying that looks matter a great deal. Her life would be completely different if she weren&#39;t an attractive white woman.  I think the title should be looks shouldnt matter but they do.,1
10580,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Saw the title and was like &quot;why you always lying?&quot;,1
10581,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,mia thermopolous,1
10582,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,there is a type of personality that makes a person think that the world is out of their control.<br><br>a person with this personality type does indeed &quot;win the lottery&quot; in this case.<br><br>the inverse is the personality type that does not rely on the world to make decisions for them.<br>these people are more successful.,1
10583,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s right: looks are powerful and have a lot of influence. They shouldn&#39;t, but unfortunately they do. Even if you just look at the word makeup, you can tell it actually tells you its fake. I&#39;m not judging people who wear makeup at all. Good for you for knowing your style! However, I try to not judge people by their looks but it&#39;s hard. Hard to not get a first impression because of society today. I truly admire this woman for getting up on this stage and telling her story.",1

10585,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what a hypocrite,1
10586,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y, Bravo! I loved this! Very honest!,1
10587,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"ya know shes right everyone in the world thinks about looks, Im 21 and ive never had a relationships and friendships few and far between. no one gives an overweight guy like me a second glance or cares what he is feeling but if someone who looks like cameron has an issue or problem then one of the millions of people and friends and guys around her will help her, and for the average attractive person it isnt millions of people but its several hundred on facebook instagram twitter snapchat etc. that all say anything to make you think highly of them. but I stopped using social media because No one ever cared what I had to say or what I was going thru yes my mother and father might respond or other certain family members but thats almost like saying my Dog responded to me when I called its name. thats what good family members do. but no one other than them have ever cared about me and its because im overweight... girls dont date fat guys and for the fat guys that have relationships Im happy you found a one in a million girl who actually doesnt care about looks. but for me It seems happiness isnt an option.",1
10588,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Biggest amount of horseshit I&#39;ve ever heard. <br><br>As someone who is ugly, looks ABSOLUTELY matter.",1
10589,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a model.<br>&quot;And I got these free things because of how I look, not who I am, and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are&quot;<br>Basically you&#39;re whole speech is about how you got everything because of your looks. And you end your speech by saying that the power of image is important.",1
10590,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"they do so much to her just to make her pretty&quot; for the shoots, they tell her how to move and everything, i understand how they&#39;re insecure.. always thinking is this good enough.",1
10591,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,WOW I&#39;ve never seen an attractive woman on TED before haha,1
10592,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"    ,    ",1
10593,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s breathing pretty hardcore,1
10594,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So articulate--thank you.,1
10595,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sooo sorry to ask but so what&#39;s her point after the talk? what i only get is, she talks about that looks aren&#39;t everything but after that she says that a lot of &quot;good looking&quot; people get much more benefits than other people, only some of the &quot;not good looking&quot; people are lucky enough to get the same benefits. And one more thing that her personality is not the same as her pictures..soo what&#39;s her point? anything i missed?",1
10596,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah I agree that &quot;look isn&#39;t everything&quot; but it sometimes play a great role on others impressions.,1
10597,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Amazing individual!,1
10598,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,it helps a lot to look good.. tbh yes personality is a great trait and feature but looks are the sealer and dealer..,1
10599,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow!She&#39;s really brave.,1
10600,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She sounds like she doesn&#39;t Ike her job,1
10601,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,oh come on. If I were as beautiful as her I wouldn&#39;t care about anything else lol,1
10602,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So many people are completely missing the point of her whole talk. She admits that she is privileged because of her looks, but that that&#39;s not how it should be. Many of you are blaming her for being a hypocrite because she is enjoying her good fortune, yet still criticizing her good fortune. Let me ask you this: How many of you own clothing made in China?  And how many of you have critisized people for child labor or unfair/low wage labor laws? Well, if you do a quick google search, you&#39;ll find out that much of our Chinese-made clothing is thanks to laborers in China that are treated terribly. Are you going to stop wearing most of your clothes? We too benefit from things that hurt others. Many of us are hypocrites, whether we recognize it or not. Well that&#39;s the world for you, you can&#39;t please everyone and there will always be critics. I greatly admire Cameron for this talk, I didn&#39;t even know her before this video.",1
10603,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There is so many things wrong about this speech I don&#39;t even know where to start from... She was too cocky and a huge hypocrite. Also,  what was she trying to say?",1
10604,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I want to win the powerball when I grow up,1
10605,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i love her,1
10606,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful...,1
10607,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I thought of her just the same way when she changed outfit.,1
10608,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t find her that cute tbh,1
10609,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Physically insecure&quot;! Cry me a river.,1
10610,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Beauty isn&#39;t everything it&#39;s the only thing&quot; - The Neon Demon,1
10611,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What a lady! Having a crush on her right now. And yes, she&#39;s beautiful to boot..!",1
10612,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"que buen video, tiene razon sobre todo lo que hablo, muchas nias a los 13 no se sienten seguras de sus cuerpos por lo que siempre vemos en las revistas y programas, aquellos que nos dicen que una mujer para ser linda debe medir 1,60, pesar 40 kilos, estar a la moda y siempre lucir perfecta. creo que este video habla de la realidad que nadie ve, de lo que criticamos sin saber que es en verdad; lo que en realidad es solo sentirse inseguros y no tener en algunas ocasiones la libertad de elegir lo que se quiere.",1
10613,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s beautiful inside and outside,1
10614,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There is no need to apologize for winning that genetic lottery. People with high IQ&#39;s don&#39;t. Cameron go to Africa and look at the fashion magazines, they are filled with black models. A model is a &#39;fantasy version&#39; of ourselves, so if we are white skinned with brown hair and brown eyes, that female who has those features, will relate best to somebody like you and think &#39;well the colors on that dress look good on her and I have similar coloring so yes I think i will buy that.&quot; Its not racism.",1
10615,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,One of the most heartfelt and interesting Ted talks I have come through.. She is just expressing her perdonal views and please people do not call her a rascist.. It is wat she experienced being a part of the modelling industry.. Thumbs up,1
10616,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Really nice talk. If only knowing this could change how people view and treated each other.,1
10617,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This woman is so smart and she taught me things I might nerver would have heard.,1
10618,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Looks&quot; never make relationships last, &quot;Attitudes &amp; Behaviours&quot; does.",1
10619,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If Cameron is so revolted by the modeling industry and what it is doing to young women in the world, why doesn&#39;t she quit being a model and do something different with her life? Obviously modeling is superficial and ridiculous, but if the entertainment industry wasn&#39;t shoved down our throats daily we might have a much more natural understanding of beauty. It&#39;s synthetic and it&#39;s intentional the way we&#39;re being hypnotized by image. Excuse my French, but it&#39;s all bullshit, and I don&#39;t know exactly how Cameron is helping. What I got from this video is that she is super lucky (for winning the modeling lottery), that her type of beauty draws the most attention (which is not true), and that if someone is ashamed of what they&#39;re doing they might as well continue doing it because it pays so well. This model is inadvertently pushing the artificial agenda of making the masses believe that physical appearance is everything. Wake up people, it&#39;s not. That is a lie based on ideologies and philosophies created by vacuous, rich, powerful people. Bring meditation, love, healing and nature back into our lives and we will not be so obsessed with looks, fame and arrogant &quot;celebrities&quot;. Everything is backwards and the modeling industry is much, much darker than she&#39;s making it out to be.",1
10620,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oh boohoo &quot;I am insecure, and I&#39;m insecure because I have to think about what I look like everyday&quot; you mean you&#39;re insecure about your beauty? Lmao",1
10621,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Misleading title. Total CLICKBAIT! If she hates her life so much, why doesn&#39;t she give all her money away &amp; stop modelling?",1
10622,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,1. she looks way better without makeup<br>2. she has an amazing mindset<br>3. she changed my perspective,1
10623,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So do I have chance then?,1
10624,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i dont get why people complain about white being the ideal skin color in beauty. like go to africa and ideal beauty skin color is black. so why should people change their beauty ideals just because the other skin color is a minority?,1
10625,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,bad title,1
10626,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"stop spreading this BS! it&#39;s not the fact that you&#39;re white that you get away with things and get free things it&#39;s because you&#39;re pretty.STOP trying to tell everyone that whites are privileged because it&#39;s not true. Those with the most about of.money are most privileged, it&#39;s about socio-economic status !",1
10627,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,that sounded like 10mins of white guilt.,1
10628,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s so easy to say these things when you&#39;ve already made it to successful model status lol. ,1
10629,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wear the right clothes for your body, be well-groomed, take care of your teeth, exercise daily any one who does this helps others see them as attractive, a good friend could help you make good choices.",1
10630,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks don&#39;t matter? Tell that to the 17 years I&#39;ve spent single...,1
10631,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She was very honest. I changed what she called &quot;legacy&quot;. Thanks for that.,1
10632,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;d rather have someone beautiful on the inside than the outside.,1
10633,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ask those who looks ugly! they will never say this!,1
10634,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"it&#39;s funny when people say looks down matter, they&#39;re usually attractive and don&#39;t understand being ugly",1
10635,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Her way of talking is amazing.,1
10636,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;looks isnt everything&quot; litterally got her life paved by her looks and the only downside is that she is somewhat insecure about her looks unlike everyone else,1
10637,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,loved every minute of the video,1
10638,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So she is ashamed to be white?,1
10639,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks are unfortunately the first impression people have of you. they decide whether they want to talk to you or not by looking at you. people decide what your personality is like just by looking at you. people decide what they think your fate might be by looking at you (how far in future you&#39;ll go). it&#39;s a misfortune for people like me that we are being judged and are futures are being decided simply because we look a certain way.,1
10640,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,very good role model,1
10641,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Rich people cannot ever say poverty doesn&#39;t matter<br>Similarly such a beautiful woman cannot ever say being ugly doesn&#39;t matter,1
10642,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks don&#39;t matter if you stay single. :D,1
10643,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I respect her.,1
10644,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So she&#39;s basically saying that looks ARE important and how lucky she is for being so attractive,1
10645,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, as they say...I&#39;ve never liked the slender model look...Most males of certain cultures just don&#39;t go for that look...",1
10646,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Money isn&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m rich.&quot; Is it just me or does that make no sense....",1
10647,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"At <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=4m00s"">4:00</a>, where she asks &quot;WHY&quot;, clearly she won another lottery of fate -She must have come from an affluent family. There are MANY young people out there who wish to become models, NOT for the ego massage or to lead a glamorous life. Being a model doesn&#39;t require any special skills or training. It can provide money for college or to fund other creative or entrepreneurial aspirations, so that one can go on to a happy and successful career doing something else!",1
10648,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i miss seeing cameron on vs,1
10649,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s amazing :) I didn&#39;t know who she was, but this was an awesome talk :D",1
10650,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s pretty much the really attractive people that can go around and tell people that looks aren&#39;t everything and get away with it, actually getting people to belive it. <br><br>And the attractive people get away with it because......well, they are attractive. <br><br><br>See what I did there?",1
10651,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"what a typical way of playing speaking true, and not telling where it is all about..... the &#39;constructions&#39; are summaries of what we need according to our biological program. There is such a judging atmosphere instead of looking where the behavior is coming from. Before we judge, please lets check out how the machine is working... so my conclusion is: good start, brave but where is the second part?  Observation without judging never stops, and reveals everything in Time. Every judgement stops observation at once. Be blessed.",1
10652,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Damn she fine,1
10653,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,!,1
10654,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,bullshit. looks are everything. and women lie about it,1
10655,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i love you.. thank you so much. &lt;3,1
10656,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She seems to have her head well screwed on. <br><br>Beauty is interesting, for many reason. When it comes to women it will get them everything. Even if they do not model, they can marry a millionaire and never have to work, simply on their looks. Beautiful women are treated like they are interesting, even when they are not. Men treat them so much better than they would treat an unattractive woman or a man, so the world is simply a much nicer place as everyone is nicer. <br><br>I&#39;ve also noticed older women that used to be beautiful have often lost their identity and can be very bitter. Because they used to be treated well and have the world at their feet and now their looks have gone they have lost the one thing that made them special.",1
10657,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You cannot simply title this woman a hypocrite. She was in no control over how she looked; she was just lucky to be deemed as &quot;attractive&quot; to the majority of society. In this talk, she is simply outlining how she is provided with benefits others are not. Like cmon, most models wouldn&#39;t be brave enough to even mention this publicly. Moral of what she is trying to say? People like her are nurtured and treated differently, it can make these people feel uncomfortable and detached from the &quot;norm&quot;. So looks cannot solely be the determinant of &quot;fulfilment&quot; or &quot;happiness&quot; in life.",1
10658,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well the main takeaway is that society itself is founded on superficiality, shallowness, and materialism. There is no philosophical or spiritual searching at all going on in the vast majority of the population. The only thing being searched for is sensual pleasures, ego, and vanity, and that is about it. That&#39;s why the modeling industry even exists. She seems smart though. She knows nothing lasts forever, that her looks will fade one day and there will be a thousand girls to replace her, and she knows the whole thing is ridiculous and she needs something deeper in life to truly be happy. She should milk the modeling industry for as much money as she can, while pointing out the ridiculousness of the whole industry at the same time, and donate a ton of that easy wealth to charity.",1
10659,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;im a pretty white girl, i won the genetic lotteryl&quot; vomit alert!",1
10660,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow,she spoke quite well!",1
10661,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she didn&#39;t mean to say that look doesn&#39;t matter... what she really meant to say was that look isn&#39;t everything<br>and she is so right<br><br>great talk!,1
10662,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,yah pretty girls can talk so lol,1
10663,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,White skin isn&#39;t inherently beautiful in our society. Tanned skin is sexy. Dark skin is sexy. Pale skin is sexy. Stop the self-proclaimed racist crap.,1
10664,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When I finished the video, I noticed she was beautiful.<br><br>Both inside and out&lt;3",1
10665,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Can&#39;t wait to watch more video&#39;s.,1
10666,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Brave woman.,1
10667,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nailed it.,1
10668,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"God, the truth hurts. Statistics are horrible, but I&#39;ll need to accept them...",1
10669,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,her cardio seem awkwardly bad,1
10670,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,bullshit.   there was girl freshmen year who looked at me in pure disgust. from then on I just kinda knew I was ugly.. ha I lost the gene pool lotto,1
10671,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She looks prettier with the skirt and the sweater. I guess looks matter after all.,1
10672,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Kudos for trying... but Cameron you really just slammed all black people and minorities! <b>**TED Talk please check over your speakers, speech before allowing them to go on stage saying  racist things**</b>  like &quot;black and minorities are not viewed as pretty and they struggle.  except for one or two like Tyra Banks.&quot; lol.   black and minority &quot;looks&quot; are widely embraced in society and even known as exotic by some. There are plenty! ...plenty of successful black and minorities as well.... we are not just struggling in the hood. Thanks for those terrible pics of us.  Learn how to get your point across better...  This speech shows me how spoil and unaware of the world you really  are...   you hate it... but you continue to work as a model. lol",1
10673,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is ANTI-WHITE.  She does not realize that WHITE is wanted by all men. It is more beautiful and is most sought out.,1
10674,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,fell in love with this sweet girl.,1
10675,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Miss Cameron Russell has looks (which she admits, and intelligently talks about its perceived understanding) and also has some character &amp; brains.<br>Many of the people in the comments bashing about the video seem to have neither.",1

10678,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,as I start watching this there was a lady wrote at the bottom of the video she wished looks do not matter butt she didn&#39;t realize looks comes from inside and not outside because if you see inward Beauty First then it makes the outward Beauty twice as beautiful Reverend James,1
10679,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,if u a female that&#39;s not considered winning a genetic lottery,1
10680,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The worlds works on superficial administrator of what is available and maybe even though a viewing glass we the students right we watch to want to look like Cindy Crawford or Vanessa Williams beautiful is amazing and vanity is gained confident and comfortable in ur own skin cause we&#39;re all different and different is beautiful.......Why do we wish to look like the next girl when the girl before was just amazing as the second see a mother with having four wonderful girls there all different but there all loved the same,1
10681,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she probably wanted to be the president of United States -,1
10682,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything?, sure sounds like it to me",1
10683,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This talk is pure hypocrisy. Is like a rich person teaching a poor African child how to be happy , give us a break.",1
10684,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,WHY are you a model than?,1
10685,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you are an angel... not by your appearance...,1
10686,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Interesting point of view.,1
10687,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow beautiful. proud of her. she&#39;s a smart girl. she knows that beauty is important. but it&#39;s not what should define u. the kind of person u r nice/giving, understanding. this proves the real u",1
10688,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;d vote for her! Russell For Pres!! This this the kind of female roll-models women need today. Very intelligent.,1
10689,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This TED talk is awful. Please don&#39;t waste your time.,1
10690,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She seemed nervous,1
10691,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Too many bleeding hearts here... that was a catastrophe of a ted talk.,1
10692,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thks for sharing the truth with me,ur courageous!",1
10693,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I try to look like a psychopath to be honest.,1
10694,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Awesome job with the photos, the &quot;real photos&quot; versus the &quot;professional photos&quot;. Good visual and great point.",1
10695,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,superficial people are the real ones. think about that,1
10696,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thankyou  Cameron. You&#39;ve put light to a sidelined area. More power to you,1

10699,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,tfw this roastie 10/10 has the audacity to say looks don&#39;t matter,1
10700,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If an ugly, over weight, hairy man tried to talk about how looks aren&#39;t everything, nobody would take him seriously. Ergo: looks matter.",1
10701,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I turned down the volume, enjoyed every second of the speech~",1
10702,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she seems like a nice girl, but I didn&#39;t like how she went on about how she won the genetic lottery...I mean all you have to be pretty much is tall and thin to be a model.",1
10703,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love what she says about those pictures being constructions. They are not real. Models like Cameron are the raw materials that  beauty illusionists use to create a faux view of women and beauty.<br><br>These are painful illusions.,1
10704,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beauty, phyaique, inherited wealth, good health, high IQ are all lotteries - nothing eye opening, maybe just reassurance from the insider of the fashion industry that the whole business is superficial",1
10705,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is just common sense, but for most pepole mbe eye opening.",1
10706,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was so great. And SO important.,1
10707,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I would like to make several points about this lady: <br>1). She doesn&#39;t look beautiful to me. Honestly. Her natural touched up self looks nothing like the untouched self. <br>2). She didn&#39;t mention that she was born into a wealthy family. They had connections to a modeling agency and signed her up.  <br>3). She doesn&#39;t look completely white to me. <br>4). After her modeling career she has a wealthy family to fall back on. Most models end up broke or become a millionaire&#39;s trophy wives. <br>5). The modeling industry is controlled by gay men, that&#39;s why so many female models look like men with long hair.  <br>6). She didn&#39;t talk about the rampant drug use among the models to cover the terrifying rate of sexual abuse in the industry.  <br>7). But, i applaud her for seeing and speaking up about the problems she did notice. Good on her for that.",1
10708,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thats sad but true,1
10709,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"My thoughts within the first minute of this video,: STOP SAYING UMM!!!",1
10710,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The title&#39;s kind of deceptive, because what she is trying to say is that looks shouldn&#39;t matter, not they don&#39;t matter. But that&#39;s kind of hard for us to humans to achieve, especially when i&#39;m 99 percent sure i&#39;m going to die alone just because i&#39;m that ugly.",1
10711,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I do not find her to be pretty - NOT AT AAAAALL! And neither can she talk, or present a speech! Boring dummy!",1
10712,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I loved your talk, very noble words cant express. Keep it up. perfect love",1
10713,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This talk is the equivalent to an intelligence vacuum.  What is the point? Looks aren&#39;t everything? It takes 3 seconds to say that, not 8 minutes, and it is completely obvious. Who on earth allowed this talk to take place?",1
10714,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t think she had a point of this talk that couldn&#39;t fit on a post it note.,1
10715,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she definitely fits my idea of what a woman should look like, but i wonder if her sandwiches are any good. there&#39;s usually an inverse correlation.",1
10716,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,OMG that body.. my pee pee keeps growing big :O,1
10717,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s like Bill Gates telling me that money doesn&#39;t matter. Ok...<br>This looks more like a show-off.,1
10718,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"My take away from this is that even if I become better looking, I won&#39;t really become happier as a person because then I would want to be even more good looking. It&#39;ll never end. Just be ok with who you are because why would you want to look like someone else even if you look better",1

10722,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Of course, to her looks aren&#39;t everything. She&#39;s never had to deal with being ugly. I have legs that work, and I am really happy to have them. But there not the source of my happiness. Try telling that to a paraplegic.",1
10723,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow wow wow. Smart and compassionate woman. One of the most informative talks. Loved it.,1
10724,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Cool talk.,1
10725,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i loved tgis video so much.i think that she spoke withe her heart dont let jealeosy define ypur opinion on this talk because if we are talking with the truth we all somehow want to be the #1.,1
10726,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Sure I&#39;d encourage a gorgeous young girl to be a model - to put away money for college and life.,1
10727,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"+Carol T. Hater alert. she sums it up at the end, otherwise known as SUMmation... &quot;the power of image in our perceived successes and failures&quot;. this is teeming in our culture. we covet or condemn very much predicated on the superficial. learn to question yourself. Are you dissenting for a good reason, or are you just hating again ???",1
10728,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what was her contribution to stop the practice which is ruining the budding kids of tomorrow from not feeling insecure about   their body images cause a talk isnt an anwser,1
10729,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i always love how pretty people go on and on about this...,1
10730,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I used to think that most models were vain and hypocrites, but Cameron changed my mind! Thank you so much for that, you&#39;re a true role model!",1
10731,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,very good message love this,1
10732,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She didn&#39;t really share very deeply. I thought she would share more of what they do besides air brushing but she didn&#39;t.  I personally don&#39;t think she wants people to know how to be a successful model. She said she was scouted but she didn&#39;t say how to be a successful model.,1
10733,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If it was about success you count the money that you&#39;ve made, invest it wisely, go to college and find your dream to fulfill your life.",1
10734,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So she is too beautiful and too white? Ugh.,1
10735,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,easy for her to say!,1
10736,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is a video that depicts social acceptance and the unfortunate fact that we as a society have not advanced too far over the past few decades in terms of racial diversity and tolerance. Reminding ourselves to be more open minded and teaching that to the next generation is so important...,1
10737,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"that was a great talk.  she is beautiful on the inside and out, intelligent, well spoken,interesting to listen to.",1
10738,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,An amazing person!,1
10739,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This should have just been called &quot;believe me I am a model&quot;.,1
10740,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,and then later despite the positive message it display dumb teenagers had create the stupidest challenge in all of history.,1
10741,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good looks are indeed not everything. Only about 99% of everything.,1
10742,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Marry me.,1
10743,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Brave. I loved the tension in her voice. I feel that way almost every day.  PEACE,1
10744,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,the most useless Ted talk ever,1
10745,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I liked this video only because of her looks.,1
10746,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Girl, youre a model. We dont want to hear you talk. We want to look at you. No offense.",1
10747,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you very much for this open minded narrative about the reality of things in our society,1
10748,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Worst TED Talk of all time.... BS of continous 10 min,1
10749,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I am lost for words. Just simply Disagree,1
10750,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I applaud her bravery,1
10751,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wish looks didn&#39;t matter,1
10752,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wish looks didn&#39;t matter,1
10753,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds.&quot;<br>No she didn&#39;t. She is still smoking hot.,1
10754,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,amazing,1
10755,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"He makes a very handsome woman, but don&#39;t we as real women deserve to have models that reflect who we are? As a pregnant female I get INDIGNANT AND INCENSED WITH MEN WEARING WIGS AND BELLY PADS PRETENDING TO BE WOMEN PROCREATING and extending family lineage! ",1
10756,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is great. I admire her courage and honesty.,1
10757,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is a very beautiful video. Hats off!,1
10758,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Happy birthday Cameron!,1
10759,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you are so wrong cameron.,1
10760,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great talk!~ Very useful to hear.,1
10761,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So the point was...?,1
10762,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"god, she is HOT. My pee pee grew big from seeing her in the dress when she came in. :O",1
10763,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why does she keep saying &quot;white&quot; as if other races can&#39;t be sexy as well ?,1
10764,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting.",1
10765,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I absolutely love her honesty!,1
10766,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lol who told her that she&#39;s beautiful? Just cut the hair, and you&#39;ll have a new boyfriend xD when I think a beautiful woman, I think of feminine and curvy like Kim K, Beyonce, Demi Lovato, ..etc, not this super skinny trans woman who looks like life was sucked out of her.",1
10767,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love this lady&#39;s speech!,1
10768,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,well I guess you&#39;re right. ppl probably clicked this video because you&#39;re the cover.,1
10769,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,<br><br>,1
10770,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I honestly came here with the intent of hating this talk, but that wouldn&#39;t be fair to her.",1
10771,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I appreciate Cameron Russell her honesty is something we don&#39;t see very often and I wish I could see where she was coming from on the whole white rich model thing but I didn&#39;t, what I did get was that she was aware of this if more ppl of privilege were just aware than the world would be a little better like don&#39;t tell me we have the same privileges when I know we don&#39;t",1
10772,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,well she just spent 10 minutes talking about looks indeed are pretty much everything.,1
10773,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow Cameron<br>   I am really impressed. Never seen anyone so real and down to earth.,1
10774,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"lovely and true girl, thanks for your sharing of your real feeling, love",1
10775,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron Russell made great points regarding the way people perceive people  based upon  their image.   .  I especially enjoyed the link she made with gender and racial oppression,  due to the stereotypes associated with physical  images.",1
10776,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t get the point..,1
10777,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wonder why she stayed with modeling so long if she didn&#39;t like it.,1
10778,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s an amazing speech, so honest and real. About so much more than just being a model in contrary to some comments I read here. It&#39;s about racism, about how the fashion world is making so many young girls insecure and how superficial and unimportant it all is. She tells an important message. It doesn&#39;t matter why she got the opportunity to stand here and talk about this issue. But that she stood up and did... Life is indeed not about looks, it&#39;s about who you are.",1
10779,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In a world where most people are demanding the government give special privledges to people because of their race or gender...  Women in the USA are not oppressed.  This successful model is a great example of how absurd the idea is - the claim that all women are oppressed by definition a priori regardless of the evidence.<br><br>If anyone has a hard time in life, is anyone is discriminated against in life...  It&#39;s not women.  It&#39;s ugly people, fat people, disabled people, people with emotional problems, people who have different personalities, people who are different in ways less obvious than gender and skin color.  I&#39;m not saying we should give them special priviledges either.  I&#39;m just saying the leftist feminists should stfu and stop spreading evil destructive counter-productive twisted lies.<br><br>People are individuals.  Let&#39;s treat people as individuals - not as members of arbitrary statistical groups used for political gain and to demand special pseudo &quot;rights&quot;.",1
10780,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To realize her full potential, Ms Russell should join the Army, where nobody cares about your facial beauty or how well you fit in your uniform. You are judged by your ability to accomplish the mission.",1
10781,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,how can you face your problem when your problem is on your face?,1
10782,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i wish she spoke a lot more, very interesting girl, great insights! very cool to hear an honest view about beautiful women.",1
10783,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i think the highest instinct of any living animal living including human is to get benefited, when you are smart people are pleased by your talk/work. when you&#39;re beautiful people get pleased by your look. it&#39;s basically the same thing. others get benefited by my quality.<br>that&#39;s why people give these blessed people opportunities/free things. why is it cheap if i born with a look like model and great if i have the talent of Einstein. It&#39;s all the same.<br><br>because at the end of the day if i born with a talent like Steve jobs or i earned the talent of Bil gates by hard work it will benefit others. no cheap/greatness in it....so why?",1
10784,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Awesome!!!!,1
10785,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she sounds so nervous,1
10786,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I believe that her talk just proved the opposite of the title, that looks can make you or break you.",1
10787,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well, I guess it&#39;s easy to say that because you&#39;re a model.",1
10788,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why do so many people say negative stuff about this video. It&#39;s just true. And it&#39;s incredibly brave of her to stand up and say things like that, to speak the truth",1
10789,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Watch the damn video before you criticize her,1
10790,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you Cameron Russell for your wholehearted talk.,1
10791,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"WTF? It&#39;s doesn&#39;t matter if she is beautiful or has money. She is a fucking human, omg. You&#39;re acting like those people who want separate humans for their look. She know that she hass privilegie for being white, skinny and beautiful. And she&#39;s not happy for that. What&#39;s wrong with your minds, people?",1
10792,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,role anyone   recognize one&#39;s better than this cdse,1
10793,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow how many people angry about this video. I think the key point is how superficial we are and how important the aesthetical values are in our society. Its a matter of education the fact that we use to believe in such kind of things. So, never believe in the media images.",1
10794,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love the honesty in this. I did a video: YOU vs YOU.  I AM just one grain of sand but together if we spread the reality of what truly is beautiful we can build a shoreline of what is real and crash the waves of distorted thinking of the children of today.,1
10795,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,very nice video ... :-),1
10796,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Find Yourself.<br>only one solution is there for you.<br>And its ISLAM.<br>because I know what you were talking about.<br>learn about ISLAM.<br>And the very moment when you Believe and Realize the TRUTH, just don&#39;t hesitate and ACCEPT ISLAM.<br><br>ISLAM IS EVERYTHING.",1
10797,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Brutally honest..loved it....amazing....keep on doing the good work...,1
10798,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good talk :),1
10799,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow ... very inspiring!,1
10800,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,yeah its easy for you to say that,1
10801,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The Seagull by Anton Chekov,1
10802,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One lesson I keep learning - look deeper.  This however is the first time I&#39;ve been taught to look deeper at those who appear to have it all, rather than just at those who appear to have nothing.  Look deeper at everyone...",1
10803,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,By the way she spoke i think she is an old soul on a pretty but wise head.,1
10804,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes its a good video... like all of the ted videos (some better than others)  and she is a outstanding model just cause doing it..... BUT i feel she needs a clearer point of why is she acctually doing this talk.....,1
10805,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s bragging. She insulted most of the sentient beings of this plane. That&#39;s not being vulnerable. She brought up that boring PhotoShop bullshit that no one cares about. She just listed a bunch of things that are wrong with-out any valuable information. This video is an abomination of reality. There are so many other things across the internet that have actual value.,1
10806,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow she is so smart , inspiring Talk  she gave us there",1
10807,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Who cares? Women?,1
10808,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This isn&#39;t the right video for me.,1
10809,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything. True. They account only for 90% of everything...<br>Studies reveal that people won won the genetic lottery have the better incomes, some jobs like models, actors are reserved to them, have easier social interactions etc.",1
10810,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Most if not all of the negativity comes from not fully understanding what was said. This is actually a systemic problem in western culture. Brainwashed  to see manufactured  beauty through the eyes of those who own and run the industry. It is not just the fashion industry it is also in the music and started from television and movies. Great Job Cameron.,1
10811,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"How you look, shapes who you are !",1
10812,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was  a great talk. She sounds very conscious.,1
10813,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Most models are White in European societies because that&#39;s the ethnic identity of the native population there. Likewise most models with be Black in African cultures.,1
10814,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Bottom line is no one&#39;s happy ever, I mean, maybe most are thinking: &quot;Well, she&#39;s ungrateful because even though she&#39;s pretty and has money for it she&#39;s still not happy&quot; but maybe she thinks &quot;That girl is so lucky, she doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s like knowing that you&#39;ll no longer be relevant in 10-20 more years, she doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to depend on your looks&quot; and both stories are true but maybe we would both agree with the other person if we lived their lives. So just live your life knowing that at the end of the day we&#39;re all human and everyone has problems to overcome no matter how perfect other&#39;s life is seen.",1
10815,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"bla bla bla bla &quot;Im a model&quot; bla bla bla loook Im beautiful bla bla bla<br>me me me me me bla bala<br>its  useless video talk,,, dont watch it",1
10816,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"99% of people die without knowing what life is? that doesn&#39;t make them less, that is life, rest everything thing is bullshit",1
10817,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It is not about what do you look. It is about who you are. People may love for for your look. But look is not something which lasts long. We must try to care about our personality. It is the stupid social convention that looks are important. Nowadays everyone thinks of the image. That why, the company and business use the image to manipulate people. This the agenda in today&#39;s world to create insecurity for people. Even though there are constant emphasizes on confidence and love your self. But what the media and society show to you is the opposite of this. This video was important is a confession from the people who work there. Hope people understand the message and Learn the power of confidentiality in oneself.",1
10818,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s amazing and I like her talk,1
10819,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She seems nervous...I would too,1
10820,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"compare this to this article: <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/9038-attractive-women-hired.html"">http://www.livescience.com/9038-attractive-women-hired.html</a> BTW. she is not only pretty, but she is also a very likealbe person ;) that helps when modeling.  I am not sure about the privileges .once you hit a certain age, the modeling biz will kick you out mercilessly. As for getting stuff for free, I see ugly people get stuff for free as well, it is called human kindness! specially to children, it happens a lot. But when you are in the modeling biz you learn to reduce everything ( and I say everything!) to your looks. it hinders you as well as it helps you. go out and earn a college degree and /or try to get a job in another industry and you will see that your privileges of beauty will turn into disadvantages faster than you can count to 3. People will not hire you if you are  pretty as a woman. <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/9038-attractive-women-hired.html"">http://www.livescience.com/9038-attractive-women-hired.html</a>",1
10821,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nooooo! She should&#39;ve stayed in that dress :3,1
10822,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Step 1: Be attractive<br>Step 2: Don&#39;t be unattractive<br>Step 3: Profit,1
10823,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks DO matter, and we are all judged by others whether it&#39;s our skin colour, accent, features or whatever religious clothing we may be wearing. It&#39;s sad that the state of the world has not progressed so much that we can&#39;t overlook these things and see the person inside, but perhaps that won&#39;t ever change, who knows. <br>On another note, I really liked her presentation skills, so flawless, how does one overcome nerves and become comfortable in talking in front of a crowd...",1
10824,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,come on.,1
10825,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Acreditem, sou uma modelo&quot;  exatamente por isso que eu NO deveria acreditar lol",1
10826,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I did an exam on this video in English class..... yes I&#39;m serious,1
10827,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,commendable speech.,1
10828,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I have to admit..I found this channel because I love the name Ted^^ All my favourite people are named Ted, and I might even name a pet after them. Being a Ted doesn&#39;t automatically make you better, but it certainly makes those odds better. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Tedforthewin"">#Tedforthewin</a>",1
10829,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love this ted talk ! She is so true and smart, and definitely explains the situation very well. I hope that generations will keep watching that one, and rethink their viewpoint on modeling, that the images they&#39;ve been fed with are not real people - to finally change it !",1
10830,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I loved what you said I my self suddenly stopped putting on make ups or fix my hair or went out with oil on my hair.. I have seen reactions of people some said she is on something  ( drugs) few thought I was busy and less thought she doesn&#39;t care cos she doesn&#39;t want to.. thanks to my husband Kushan for making me believe and motivated me that it doesn&#39;t matter and how beautiful i am.. and I am beautiful we all are..,1
10831,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for sharing you INNER beauty with all of us.  You are an inspirational role model!,1
10832,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she failed to mention the hideously nasty jealous bullying the pretty girls will forever endure from other women... Am I the only one here?  Also the constant sexual harassment from men...  is she really that privileged  that she got all the benefits of being pretty and none of the drawbacks?  where is the truth in that?  Also y doses she assume she got the dress for free because she was pretty and not because she was young and they felt sorry for her. She&#39;s talked about how lucky she is because she is pretty and has generalised that to all pretty girls. If she really has none of the horrible drawbacks to being pretty then she is lucky not because she is pretty but because she doesn&#39;t get the horrible crap from ppl which comes from being pretty. I was hoping to hear about how much crap pretty girls get but I heard none, just the repeated and false mantra that if you are a pretty white person you have one the lottery. All she is doing is perpetuating these falsehoods and causing more scathing hatred and abuse for pretty women. Thank you Cameron Russell, how eye opening.",1
10833,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great to hear a beautiful woman acknowledge the huge advantages her looks have given her -not just the lucrative career but also how in everyday circumstances, the rules which apply to everyone else are overlooked with beautiful women. When you&#39;re young, beautiful and rich,it&#39;s easy to live in a bubble,soCameron&#39;s self-awareness is impressive. Many models/actresses will tell us it&#39;s their great work ethic/attitude which has landed them their career, as if their looks played a mere secondary role.",1
10834,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,such an inspirational speech! thank you,1
10835,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she was so lovely,1
10836,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why are these TED-titles always so ... not thought through at all? raw? unfitting? stupid?,1
10837,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she is lovely as she is no matter the look and looks really honest to me. We live in a society that goes by the look, just look at the applications like tinder, first thing you go by is the picture",1
10838,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She seems very nice, and honest. Many models suffer insecurities, because they are judged on their looks alone, and that is a difficult industry to be apart of. It is vital to find self worth, self confidence and self love in life whatever world you work in.",1
10839,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She breathes a lot.,1
10840,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s talking about how &quot;Fabricated&quot; the modeling industry is and she also talks aboutprivilege (of being pretty and white), and I think she did an awesome job explaining it from her experience/perspective!I enjoyed the slideshow juxtaposing her &quot;real&quot; life withher&quot;work photos.&quot; It made her seem very real, and much like a person I would have met in college or on vacation. Just a person.Kudos to her for standing up and talking about something that made her vulnerable to the negative attacks/comments that she was expecting, and trying to tell others that &quot;everything is not what it seems.&quot;",1
10841,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you don&#39;t like how bad and evil the modelling industry is, there is a solution; don&#39;t work in that industry. Find a job where you actually have to use your brain and not really on your looks. If you choose to be a model, then you are chosen ENTIRELY for your looks and your looks only, and that is a decision that you make, it has nothing to do with &quot;muh gendur opreshenz&quot;. <br>You&#39;re a good looking, rich woman and yet you still act like a victim. Jesus Christ.",1
10842,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s kind of acting like she&#39;s ashamed of being a slender white women.....,1
10843,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this is amazing,1
10844,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,fantastic talk!,1
10845,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"well modeling is not about any subtle beliefs or humanitarian or philosophical aspects, its just about making money for designers and manufacturers of goods and nothing else. The word &quot;model&quot; itself depicts it pretty exactly as it is: It&#39;s just a pattern or a template of a human entity, not a real person. And of course this business is superficial and artificial, its in the nature of things..designers are selling dreams, wishes and projections and not an image of the real world or reality...",1
10846,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i hate Ted talks!!! forced to watch by college professors...,1
10847,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this sucks,1
10848,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s gorgeous and articulate.,1
10849,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Honestly, I&#39;m disgusted with my good looks sometimes, I can&#39;t explain it all because it will take too much effort from me. ",1
10850,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,great talk!,1
10851,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How can i get genetic lotteries?,1
10852,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL I WILL NEVER AGAIN BE INSECURE,1
10853,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ted,1
10854,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If white skin is prefered, why does she need a tan?",1
10855,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There are a lot of comments on here about how she is a hypocrite for being beautiful/rich/fill-in-the-blank and saying that all of that stuff isn&#39;t important. You are all missing the point. She is saying that it IS important, but that it SHOULDN&#39;T BE. She is being so brave and vulnerable by standing up on stage and admitting that the world she benefits from is the same world others get hurt by. You can&#39;t criticize a model for being blind to her privileges and then criticize her for seeing and standing up against those same privileges. She can&#39;t change the way she looks and how the world favors her, so I commend her for doing SOMETHING to combat this issue.",1
10856,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You&#39;re pretty awesome :),1
10857,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hmm. I found this mostly interesting from a psychology standpoint, seeing how she views the world and what she thinks people think about her.",1
10858,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think want she meant was that she got so many privileges because of how she looks but she wasn&#39;t happy to get them.<br>She meant that true hapinnes doesnt come because of looks.<br>Looks don&#39;t matter!,1
10859,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,how did i end up here,1
10860,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,great speech,1
10861,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this came to a close too early,1
10862,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is trying to say do something with your life looks are mostly manufactured and temporary.,1
10863,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Straight to the point.,1
10864,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t have any insecurities, <br>I know I am not the best looking guy in the world. Or Decent looking.<br>I know I will never be rich<br>I know I will never be built like an Adonis. That takes work and dedication.<br>I know I will never have the girl of dreams. <br><br>That&#39;s a good thing because honestly I don&#39;t want them.<br><br>I have in my life screwed myself over many times trying to get these things. But I realized shortly after my 24th birthday that I didn&#39;t want them anymore. Its too much time and effort for nothing.<br><br>I appreciate the fact that I am a decent looking guy. I don&#39;t even care how I look, because I am free from conformity, I am an individual, and I think for myself and I am creative, and Intelligent, and not superficial.<br><br>I think I would be driven to madness if I had money, and the women that only care for my money.<br><br>I am glad I am a Caveman, because I get to be me. Unfiltered, uncensored and a fucking jerk whenever I can be, and a gentleman.",1
10865,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;i&#39;m a supermodel and i&#39;m insecure because i have to worry about how i look all the time&quot; wow you poor fucking thing,1
10866,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"1) all of us in the comments have insecurities; why would models and other celebrities be any different? they are human, are they not? just bc they&#39;re famous and rich, they&#39;re not immune to hatred, criticism, and negativity. <br>2) &amp;&amp; there&#39;s a difference between being happy and being grateful. You don&#39;t have to be both, and that can apply to popularity and money the most. Popularity and money can&#39;t make a person entirely happy or entirely satisfied, its physically and mentally not enough.<br>3) Looks are deceiving. She&#39;s saying people&#39;s actions towards others are dependent on looks when it shouldn&#39;t be. That&#39;s what a majority of society is like, we can&#39;t help it overnight. She&#39;s pretty, and people are nicer to her. But she could also be the rudest person in the world, and some wouldn&#39;t care. <br>4) Another woman&#39;s beauty is not the absence of your own. I find it sad how girls are getting increasingly younger in realizing that their body is not perfect and they hate it bc of its lack of perfection. You need to be your body&#39;s best friend. You wouldn&#39;t hate your best friend for her lack of perfection.",1
10867,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this speech moved me,1
10868,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,No body is perfect.. but every one know some thing which other not...so we can learn some thing new from every body but not all from only one in recent age. She did well in managing n expressing her inner feelings....,1
10869,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Baby you are hot I want you,1
10870,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I feel like a lot of folks just read the title of the video, saw that she was a beautiful woman who was about to talk about &quot;how looks don&#39;t matter&quot;, and just tuned out every actual point that she was making in her talk. For what it&#39;s worth, I felt like she made some very intelligent and truthful points, and there&#39;s a lot of stupid negativity in this comment section because most people can&#39;t be bothered to actually listen to what someone has to say. They just want to latch onto what they perceive that they won&#39;t like, and stick to that. It&#39;s a shame because they&#39;re missing out on a good perspective.",1
10871,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Around <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=3m23s"">3:23</a> the &quot;lottery&quot; metaphor sums up what I think so perfectly. Isn&#39;t it amazing how over different periods of time and areas, there are different ideals of beauty? If you are considered beautiful in any period of time, you are extremely lucky because likely in another era and place, you wouldn&#39;t be.",1
10872,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,its natural when you meet peoople to know you like them within mins she is taking it too far,1
10873,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol this entire comment section is a salt mine.,1
10874,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,who invites a model to speak eewwww,1
10875,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I liked what you have sad , I think you have told us a lot of your feelings and it is true , but I can say , some people would work as a mode just to have money ....which is every one is looking for it , until you have a lot of it , he may be , be satisfy .",1
10876,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I quit modeling because I was sick of being praised for the way I look when I know I am smart and talented as well and a hard worker.  Go to college people.  Looks can only get you so far.,1
10877,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she&#39;s tall, pretty and an underwear model",1
10878,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"one part was missing, I didn&#39;t count the exact number but at least six more professionals had an opportunity to employ their skills and were paid handsomely when constructing the image......self cynicism doesn&#39;t help....:-) you are also lucky to be a part of the society who is willing to value aestheticism and allowed you totransform your image on the stage ( which is not genetic , I guess). :-)",1
10879,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she didn&#39;t mention how she was born in to a family of millionares.,1
10880,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"it&#39;s okay to own our privileges as long as we aren&#39;t rubbing them in the faces of others. body features, gender, race, education, religion...all categories we use in reducing who we&#39;d rather be friends with or go the extra mile for. I appreciate her honesty about her privileges...looks aren&#39;t everything but they mean much (sometimes much more than they ought to) in our society",1
10881,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,C O P E<br>O<br>P<br>E,1
10882,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Okay so she was trying to open our eyes to the fact that models aren&#39;t stupid, shallow or oblivious. They know that their industry is unfair, but just like everybody else in the world, they can still make use of their best and most favourable assets as we all would. She is mostly expressing her pain that she realises about the injustice, she is aware and feels some guilt for making use of an unjust system. But I understand cause as I said, we all do this to benefit ourselves how we can. So, thank you for being honest Cameron. She felt she is the wrong candidate to point out the injustice of our society whilst she is on the benefiting end but I relate to some degree about political systems and societal associations. We didn&#39;t create the systems and perhaps if we had more authority, we&#39;d change them. However, if not then, we will still be admitting of our making the most of what the world is. Like everyone else. Doesn&#39;t mean we are ignorant. We are just surviving too.",1
10883,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow...very well and intelligently put. Congrats!,1
10884,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She was so nervous... She honestly had no point. .,1
10885,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,no entendi nada o.o,1
10886,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t think she won the genetic lottery at all. I think Scarlett Johansson did.,1
10887,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I feel like a lot of people have read the title and assumed something about the video where the actual point is something a bit, (a lot) more nuanced than that",1
10888,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Depression is a disease that no one is safe from.,1
10889,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Money is everything! truth is No MONEY no food, no money no education and no education no job no future....",1
10890,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"to the people who relate this too money, Money isn&#39;t everything for example many rich people.. lets say Justin bieber, rich at a young age.. now 22. He has potentially done everything money related that he could fit on his bucket list.. What do you do once you&#39;ve done all the things you&#39;ve ever wanted too do? What is there too look forward too in life? Now he&#39;s acting up, getting more depressed, only a matter of time before he acts up again.. Many celebs do this.. money also takes away trust it&#39;s hard too find a partner, Although justin has good looks. It&#39;s going to be extremely hard for him too find a girlfriend that he loves, for the long hall. They most likely have to be rich too. This is why SO many rich celebrities become addicted too drugs. Lots of Money is not everything, these things can destroy you. Especially mentally.",1
10891,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is only on this ted talk because she is good looking.,1
10892,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,hope is good,1
10893,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"so she is insecure, ok, but where and when? in her job. Everybody has insecurities in their jobs. What about her social life?",1
10894,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I own a Ferrari. It is so hard for me to maintain it. Everyday polishing it, moving it out of the house to keep its engine healthy. The astronomic cost of the insurance that makes me work day and night to pay it... And then those calls of admiration and envy when o drive it around. They judge me for what I have not for what I am. It is so sad. I wish I had a cheapest car. One of those old European cars from the seventies. Second hand, almost broken. Only that way I would be my real self. But some alien made save money and work hard for having a Ferrari. That is the real true.",1
10895,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,it s not so easy. your  arms and hands limited smile are signalized you are still holding back.  So you must ask a question why I am do that?,1
10896,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"if she was ugly, she would&#39;ve wished to be a model...<br> she got enough of satisfaction.",1
10897,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She concludes with iF. &quot;If there;s a take-away to this talk...&quot;. This is a blatant admission that she is talking to no point: wasting our time asking us to maybe feel sorry for her cause some problems go with her great privileges. SAY WHAT???,1
10898,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,                &#39;.,1
10899,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was wonderful,1
10900,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow!  So Pleased, so proud, so wonderful, your beauty shined from the inside out.  Thank you.",1
10901,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,beauty is powerful but it doesn&#39;t last forever,1
10902,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Blah blah blah, all I hear is first world problems narrated by a person that took all the perks of being a model and is now dreading the effects of that career path on her political future (?). I&#39;m sorry, nobody forced your hand to be a model, you could have went and been anything, but it&#39;s easy for you to be natural and show those pictures of yourself just being a normal human being, when you set the standard for beauty whatever you do also becomes a standard. I don&#39;t buy the whole thing, sorry. Looks are everything and you just solidified that idea I have rather than change it. When you&#39;re good looking you can do anything and still be sought after and wanted. That&#39;s all I got from that video.",1
10903,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Look at all the bitter people in the comment section.,1
10904,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"great video,tks ad",1
10905,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow.  She&#39;s apparently saying that she&#39;s having a hard time bieng beautiful.....  Or thats how i understood this video.  ,1
10906,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Islam is a great giftI feel sorry for all of these girls who suffer from how much pressure society and media puts on the &quot;perfect body&quot; thing .. Most important is to be healthy and happy in your journey of life for men and women equal,1

10908,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I also did not see the purpose of this video... here is what I understood...<br>She became a model by choice...<br>She is insecure because she has to take care of her body and looks because of her job?!?!? <br>She is insecure that people judge her because of the pictures they see?? Who thinks that way :D <br>Yes model&#39;s are messed up, but so is every other people on the planet with a profession or without a profession... thin or fat... black or white... You made a million bucks with those campaigns, but others didn&#39;t. You are well off than others because of the career choices you have made. Talking against that is just plain disrespectful to your own life :/<br><br>PS: I am a photographer and value all models as people not as mannequins. But if a model calls herself a &quot;pro&quot; she should be able to deliver all the things a model can deliver. Or else she just gets pushed back the line.. like any other profession.",1
10909,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People are blaming her for saying that looks aren&#39;t everything. It really isn&#39;t. It&#39;s the attitude you pessimists have in life that makes you think that superficial things like looks and wealth matter.,1
10910,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,her breathing is turning me on!!,1
10911,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,CANDID,1
10912,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s awesome in every aspect..,1
10913,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"OK , stop it people. she didn&#39;t say looks don&#39;t matter. She staged that looks do matter even though it shouldn&#39;t. And everything in the model magazines are lots of faking and well construction. it&#39;s not REAL! Good looks doesn&#39;t equal happy, that&#39;s the point of the talk. The title is just really misleading.",1
10914,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Who looked her up after she said she was a model? (   )<br>Will you look her up now I tell you she&#39;s an underwear model? (   ),1
10915,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything..what a LOAD OF CROCK....Bec it Opens Doors/Opportunities usually &amp; normally Unavailable to others.,1
10916,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People are so mad at models should really be angry at the people who feed into propagating the desire Perhaps look at yourself,1
10917,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love her personality she is also my shero,1
10918,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I also grew up &quot;sexy,&quot; but my sexiness came from a lower income neighborhood where I cashed in on being an exotic dancer after a few minor modeling engagements. The problem that I acknowledge is that regardless of outstanding grades, and even promoted early, no one recognized my abilities. Instead, they&#39;d compliment my legs or breasts -- genetics. It wasn&#39;t until I encountered amnesia I stopped and realized I needed to do what I&#39;ve always loved doing. I needed to become a writer. <br><br>I applaud you, Cameron, for coming out and explaining your emotions to clarify that modeling doesn&#39;t mean your way is paved for you the rest of your life. When I see the entertainers of my era, who have undergone failed plastic surgery in hopes of hanging onto their physical image it saddens me. I wish they could also have endured the horrific amnesia I dealt with, because despite the heartache and turmoil, they&#39;d be happier too. Thanks again for sharing!",1
10919,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great speech. I&#39;m a 5&#39;&#39;2&#39; black woman and I really appreciate your efforts to selflessly talk about subjects that matter to a lot of people. Thx.,1
10920,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Maybe instead of trying to get others to step into her shoes, she should try stepping in <b>other</b> people&#39;s shoes FIRST.",1
10921,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you think that being a model is really cool thing yes it is true but the other truth is that not everyone can be a model because you need to work hard and you cannot eat what you want and it is not just that. If we talk about this speech, it was not about being a model, actually it was about prejudice. I cannot believe people can say bad things about that speech",1
10922,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great talk Cameron. Your analysis was very helpful and interesting.. Thank You.,1
10923,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great points. Not well understood by those who buy the illusion.,1
10924,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am glad I am good looking (not a model lol), I know for a fact that good looks opened doors for me, helped me in employment,  I had more forgiven tickets, then I can remember, bosses were better to me then to others, I never had to work hard to get a date, and can attract attention even in pajamas and even now. But I am also happy, bright, cheerful and kid a lot. So no, looks is not everything, but its good to be good looking :p",1
10925,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;d love to hear her do another Ted talk, but with maybe better preparation.  She seems very sincere and intelligent.  But his...what a mess of a talk...   I&#39;m here.. I&#39;m there... my take away is ????  Started great, and then just died a horrible death.",1

10929,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Easy to say looks don&#39;t matter when you admit you&#39;ve won a &quot;genetic lottery&quot;,1
10930,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The only issue I have is that despite all her insight she still continues to model perpetuating the exact thing she wants to end. It&#39;s tough to walk away from easy money like that I understand but those are the tough decisions that need to be made.,1
10931,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nice job! Your lecture was very insightful and witty. Thank you,1
10932,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Looks don&#39;t matter&quot; is a polite way of saying &quot;You&#39;re fucking ugly!&quot;,1
10933,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thank you, Cameron.  You seem genuine and likable and I liked your message, esp. for girls aspiring to become models.  Ignore the haters.  Haters gonna hate.  Your talk was interesting and funny.",1

10942,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"As stated in a previous comment: &quot;I&#39;m so tired of beautiful people saying that beauty isn&#39;t important, rich people saying that money isn&#39;t important, etc.&quot; My question is... Why? It seems logical to assume the opinions of the people who thrive in these subjects are more often &#39;correct&#39; compared to the opinions of the people who don&#39;t thrive in these subjects. Some &#39;beautiful&#39; people tell you this so you can save your time and go do other productive things. They have been there and have seen the light. They are only telling you that the light is not as bright as you think it is, and that the hue is not what you imagine it might be. I think these people have every right to say these things since they take the delusions out of the delusional. I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m certainly not tired of doctors speaking of health, authors speaking of literature, or the beautiful speaking of beauty. The truth should be taken as is, no matter how pleasant or unpleasant.",1
10943,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s our choices that make us! Not our looks or money. We choose to be happy and look good, so we will and vice versa. Build yourself up and don&#39;t let the society tell you what is good and what is bad. You know it very well.",1
10944,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The comments are ridiculous. You&#39;re all saying how she&#39;s a good looking person saying &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything,&quot; but what if she wasn&#39;t good looking and said that? Y&#39;all would just say she&#39;s trying to make herself feel better. Can&#39;t we just look at everything positively because if not, we can pretty much ALWAYS find something negative.",1
10945,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she is great! i wish to see more of her talks, it was too short",1
10946,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m guessing that most of the people commenting here paused the video after 2 minutes to leave their comment and made their decision about what the message was before even hearing it. Either that or it went right over their heads.,1
10947,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Screw you..you are good lucking and you feel insecure..imagine how ugly people feel (me included) when they don&#39;t just feel insecure but helpless that they can do nothing to turn the tables..,1
10948,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"great video, despite all the negative comments about you, you&#39;re still you. that matters. it can&#39;t be easy being you, too much false judgements...",1

10952,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I read the title and I&#39;ll be honest I was a little bitter but then I listened to her speak and I respect what she said. I understand it&#39;s easier to just be resentful, but I think she&#39;s hoping to communicate something very real. I respect her using her platform like this, and I respect her ",1
10953,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"These negativecomments were left by insecure unhappy people who&#39;ve been told their entire lives thatcontentment is based on the superficiality of wealth and beauty. When someone that has either one or both tells them it&#39;s overrated they immediately defend, deflect and deny any modification to their existing programming. It&#39;s really a sad state of affairs but absolutely predictable. It&#39;s much easier to lie to people than convince them they&#39;ve been lied to- Mark Twain.",1
10954,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If ever you wanted to know what privilege is, watch this video.  This is what privilege looks and sounds like.  So condescending too.  &quot;I know all the women in the audience who are less attractive than me, i.e. everyone, are totally intimidated by how I&#39;m dressed, so I&#39;m going to put on this shapeless skirt, flat shoes, and baggy sweater in order to make you feel more comfortable.&quot;  And, &quot;It&#39;s so terrible how my fame as a model gets me free clothes, or how my looks get me out of traffic tickets.  That really sucks.&quot;",1

I was thin and beautiful when I was young, and now I&#39;m 55, 70 lbs overweight, disabled, with grey hair (except I color it pink and purple). It has taken me a life-time to learn to love myself, I&#39;m still learning, but I&#39;m happier now than I have ever been, and I look worse!

10970,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree, looks don&#39;t mean much, if you don&#39;t have it. But we all know how good looking people can earn other people&#39;s trust more easily.",1
10971,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow this is worse than Donald Trump. To go on a stage and rant about how you won the genetic lottery, of course looks aren&#39;t everything when you can be that much of an idiot. Thanks for making the point. <br>Oh and before showing off, at least make sure not to look as though you haven&#39;t eaten for days ;)",1
10972,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yeah,yeah.yeah",1
10973,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,though u r an exellent example of the female form I find your thought patterns and honesty most apealing (sexy).,1
10974,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Where can I get that skirt?,1
10975,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That is a table cloth that she put on?,1
10976,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she is wonderful &lt;3,1
10977,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I really liked what she said, I&#39;m not sure why everyone is so offended.",1
10978,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I can&#39;t believe how many bad things people have to say about this video. This talk was heartfelt and emotional, and it was an acknowledgment that there is more to focus on in life than looks and wealth. So many models wouldn&#39;t even bother to do something like this or have the sense of self worth. She is a hero in my book.",1
10979,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Who cares what people think about your looks! Your wonderful! Its your personality that matters. if your kind then people will like you for who you are!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
10980,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,people who are negative didn&#39;t even watch the video,1
10981,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well if you watch the video she says that looks do matter. The message of the video is not that looks aren&#39;t everything, but to show that white privilege exists. If anythings she could have concluded it better but I thought the point was clear.",1
10982,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This was pretty good.however I watched this hoping that it would have been more about what type of judging I endured. As an only child, automatically think! Spoiled Brat! Not the case. My parents both worked, had to work, due to the fact that they supported  2 of theyre disabled parents. I did receive an allowance..very small.Well any way. I was not a lazy kid either. So I would do what I could to make a buck, raking leaves, delivering newspapers etc. But any how I had found the greatest, cheapest thrift store there ever was. I would go in there and look for Designer Labels, which were the same price as Walmart. Anyway I was so picked on for being an only child with the great clothes. Also when you are an only child, friends are important, I did not see color, or looks, or how poor any one was, so then my Mom started getting phone calls from her alleged friends, as to what is your kid doing with this one or that one. I really went through a lot, all of my school days, all for being an only child, who only did what I thought I was supposed to do. But in the end, it all made me a great person, and nothing has changed as how I look at people, even as an adult.",1
10983,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true...I like hearing what she says but looks play an important role. At least the men that I have seen around in my life are almost all attracted to looks. Those that I know saying are not attracted to looks have extremely low self esteem, and seem that they are happy of whatever they can get! this is really sad but that&#39;s how I have experienced so far. I gained 15 kg due to a problem and the attitudes toward me completely changed.",1
10984,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The point of her talk was that she is privileged, that it is unfair that she is, and that that privilege does not always make you happy. It&#39;s very smart and I am appalled that so many people want to bring more negativity to this woman.",1
10985,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
10986,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m currently wondering if 90% of the people in the comments even bothered to watch the whole video...,1
10987,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What&#39;s up with all the stupid &quot;hot white chick tells us beauty isn&#39;t everything&quot; comments? Did you even listen to a word she said?<br>She is saying exactly the opposite - that her success is thanks to her beauty which is the result of a genetic lottery, and also thanks to legacy of racial/cultural oppression. She is honest - if you aren&#39;t white or beautiful you need to find another way to succeed. And in the meantime - let&#39;s try and change the society so that it isn&#39;t so for future generations. Brutal and honest. Great talk.",1
10988,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The girl who pretty much had everything given to her as a good looking girl says looks as everything,1
10989,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,jo,1
10990,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You can speak for yourself, you make a good case, you are pretty. That will not not do",1
10991,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,They were men?! Tha&#39;ll be used agaubst Swedens immigrattinbs,1
10992,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Don&#39;t get me wrong, you&#39;re very pretty. you had you period 4 years ago",1
10993,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You are cute, sure. Obviously yoyu have to say tu&#39;re cute enough",1
10994,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are not that pretty,1
10995,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I was so sure, as the words were forming, that she was going to say, &quot;and last year, of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked; 86% of them were UGLY people.&quot;<br>Damn that would have been hilarious.",1
10996,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It doesn&#39;t stop with caring less about how you look.It goes withcaring less about how others look. Who does that ?,1
10997,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,it&#39;s great to say beauty is nothing but try to search who she dated. apparently it&#39;s still important to her. And when you attack the modeling industry don&#39;t keep your modeling photo on instagram it&#39;s not serious.<br>So saying models are not who we have to find beautiful is great (and everyone knows photoshop now so no need to tell us) but she should not try to make us beleive it&#39;s not important to her. She will never know what is to be watching as same as garbage to not say crap specially when you are young (and after too of course).,1
10998,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,annoying...beauty  beauty beauty...you wanted your 8 million views...People like me and others that are beautiful but aren&#39;t models don&#39;t stand on stages to get millions of views...there are plenty of us beautiful people without your self endowed speeches...attempts at comedy and another chance just to be on camera....we are all insecure...but we have REAL problems...not superficial problems.,1
10999,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m a millionaire and being a millionaire is hard, trust me, I&#39;m a millionaire. (basically exactly what the title can be equated too. Of course you think otherwise if you have it good)",1
11000,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I totally agree,<br>Look is not everything <br>money is.<br>and gold too.<br><br>maybe next on ted-ed:<br>a millionaire given lectures about how the money is not that important???",1
11001,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"ok, now ate <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=3m25s"">3:25</a> she start make sense.",1
11002,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"too many fake laughs, jesus, why her???????",1
11003,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,BRAVO CAMERON RUSSELL,1
11004,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s awesome, I love her for her ideas!",1
11005,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,my god<br>a white woman  acknowledging her privilage.,1
11006,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I really appreciate Cameron&#39;s honesty and letting young girls out there know that image is powerful and image is SUPERFICIAL!! I think that it is powerful that she mentioned how being a model reinforces society&#39;s idea that the images that you see in the magazines of women looking sexy,  posing seductively, having  Eurocentric or &quot;white&quot; features, is how all women should look like, and that you need to have that kind of beauty in order to feel accepted and worthy in society. But the funny thing is, these images in the magazine are constructed, airbrushed, and SUPERFICIAL! Not to mention, it reinforces racial inequality, and the fact that there are so many women from different ethnic backgrounds that are not represented in the magazines that we see today, particularly women of color and other non-white ethnicities. As a white woman, Cameron is being honest and owns up to the fact that she was or is a part of that contribution to racial inequality and construction of Eurocentric beauty as more valuable and desired. She is socially conscious and aware of the implications that this has on our society. Why young girls, black and white have body issues and low self-esteem? Why a non-white person is more likely to get stopped by police on the streets? Been socially conscious is more powerful and owning up to the privileges of been a white female in society! Can we all start to be socially conscious and own up?",1
11007,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How many good looking people have you seen throughout your life? Now tell me how many times have you ever thought about them? You don&#39;t bc you know nothing about them or have never talked to them before so thats why personality matters.,1
11008,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is smokin&#39;hot. Makes her life much easier, I suspect. Much like skinny birds telling fatties to be &#39;happy as they are&#39;.",1
11009,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she&#39;s very wrong when she says for centuries women have been defined as beautiful as tall &amp; slender. Fat used to denote health fertility &amp; beauty, just look at paintings in the 18th century. Stop bashing her, she&#39;s saying important things about how shallow beauty &amp; the fashion industry are. Also, short women are considered beautiful in Hollywood, Eva Longoria #1 on Maxim&#39;s list twice only 5 feet tall, Jessica Alba Halle Berry, Reese Witherspoon, tons of other short to normal-petite sized women. And they model, Nastia Liukin Former Olympic gymnast models, 5&#39;2 &amp; more beautiful legs than any victoria secret model (combo of genetics &amp; muscles in the right place) &amp; sooo many more. The only-tall is a myth created by the fashion industry &amp; debunked by Hollywood. A lot of Playmates have been well under fashion height.",1
11010,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s so beautiful and smart,1
11011,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks suck when it comes to sales woman hate me and men just want to flirt,1
11012,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Loved the content of the speech, and I guess she was quite nervous! Considering that it was probably on of her first times giving a talk like this, it was good. But that aside, the talk couldve been more fluent and the points she made couldve been stretched out and explained more and better.",1
11013,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This should be shown to all high school girls.,1
11014,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nicely done!,1
11015,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I dont think that she said something new. We already know that. maybe she wanted to talk in TED for more exposure!,1
11016,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Honestly, who cares? It doesn&#39;t matter who you are in this world, skinny, fat, tall, short, beautiful or ugly. Everyone has their own equally difficult challenges regardless of who they are. <br><br>It&#39;s the fact that human beings will always want what they can&#39;t or don&#39;t have. But that&#39;s what fuels our dreams and ambitions to live life. We will never be satisfied.",1
11017,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Everything isn&#39;t looks. Don&#39;t trust me, I&#39;m a random youtube comment.",1
11018,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s beautiful :),1
11019,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Booooring,1
11020,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Kudos&#39;s to you Cameron!  Everybody has their &quot;lot&quot; in life and your life&#39;s journey could have been very different but nothing is easy.  There are always people judging.  I&#39;m just over 5&#39; tall and I got picked on because I was short.  Nobody is perfect and I just wish we could all stop judging and love one another - just as we are.   Also, It&#39;s very difficult to get up in front of people and be authentic.  Anybody who criticizes someone doing this - unless you are a PRO at giving a talk to a group - chill!!  Thanks for sharing your thoughts and your experience Cameron.",1
11021,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,May interest to those who work in  glamour industry.,1
11022,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks don&#39;t matter my looks get me everything what the what this talk made zero sense,1
11023,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks don&#39;t matter my looks get me everything what the what this talk made zero sense,1
11024,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Is it just me or is the title of this talk so incredibly illogical?,1
11025,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"too short, would have liked to hear more. only scratched the surface, but good",1
11026,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything&quot;. That is so easy to when you are a model. People get rejected every day because of their looks. If looks aren&#39;t everything, then why do people reject each other before they even know a person&#39;s personality?",1
11027,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I can sum up the comments in one word... Insecurity,1
11028,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this was my first tedx talk!,1
11029,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really love this ted talk shes not trying to say that its not about looks shes saying that it is and that needs to change and that race changes the perception of you that people have...,1
11030,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Money isn&#39;t everything, trust me because I&#39;m a debt-free, well fed, connected, powerful, easily college educated wealthy person.",1
11031,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Maybe you get free stuff if you are beautiful on the outside, but when you are beautiful on the inside - that&#39;s when you get the absolutely best things in life that money doesn&#39;t buy: truth, freedom, love.",1
11032,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,eye of the beholder:  she&#39;s pretty but far from the most beautiful.,1
11033,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thank you for acknowledging your privileges,1
11034,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great talk... but her changing into her different outfit didn&#39;t make her any less beautiful. Are people that easily fooled?,1
11035,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,         (),1
11036,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think, pretty people (the one who are perceptive enough to know that they are more privileged than others in many aspects of life) need not feel bad about their genetic advantages; and ugly people need to stop the self-pity thoughts, stop hating on the others and try to improve on other areas of their lives. <br>Trust me, I am ugly and you are much better off doing something meaningful to your life, than crying about how unfair it is; and you can&#39;t blame people if they take advantage of what is bestowed upon them, whether it&#39;s beauty, wealth, etc.",1
11037,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I can vouch for this. Looks aren&#39;t everything.  It&#39;s just not as easy as it looks being hot. All you wanna be&#39;s, trust me, it&#39;s high pressure, high focus being the dream guy of every chick you meet.",1
11038,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was by far the worst TED talk I&#39;ve ever listened to.,1
11039,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"After seeing this I have decided she is the most beautiful(mind, body,spirit) of any model I have encountered. Young woman I applaud you.",1
11040,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Cameron Russell YOU ROCK !!! NO WORDS AFTER LISTENING TO HER TALK,1
11041,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a witty and insightful talk!,1
11042,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow,1
11043,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In my opinion her speech was great and she is kind of an idol for me now. It might be correct that good looking people do have more options and an easier life, but not necessarily in her case, I THINK.",1
11044,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ain&#39;t it funny when a beautiful person is telling a room full of. average and ugly looking people that looks ain&#39;t everything?,1
11045,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s amazing,1
11046,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful message. I only wish more people could see this,1
11047,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"now she looks beautiful, after this talk..",1
11048,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lucky me!  I live in Egypt &amp; here looks REALLY aren&#39;t important, cz no matter how you look like, men will always treat you badly. Our society hates women, attractive or not!",1
11049,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,then stop working as a model and be who u r or what u claim u want to be! I hate hypocrite people damn they are annoying! u could have been the president instead of showing ur body to public! talk talk talk no actions u could be a politician!,1
11050,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,very interesting,1
11051,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful People: &quot;Looks don&#39;t matter.&quot;,1
11052,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This really inspired me to be the short, fat, ugly, black woman inside of me that is desperately trying to get out.",1
11053,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So brutally honest.,1
11054,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I know she came forward to talk about that look aren&#39;t every thing and I do respect that, especially telling young girls this message. However, lets see the lineup of her current/ex boyfriends.  Lemme guess, about 6&#39;4&quot;, dark hair, blue eyes, looks a little like Tom Brady. Looks are something ma&#39;am.",1
11055,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The &quot;Looks don&#39;t matter&quot; cliche was invented by good-looking people, so the ugly people wouldn&#39;t feel bad about themselves. LOL",1
11056,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This woman seems to feel a lot of guilt. That&#39;s sad.,1
11057,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Maybe it&#39;s her looks, but she seemed sincere and quite disturbed by the facts. I&#39;m sure there are a thousand things she would have liked to shout out to help those who admire her or her work. To tell an uncomfortable truth. However I believe we all know what she was trying to say, most of us  just don&#39;t believe it or don&#39;t care.",1
11058,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I watched the first half of this and turned it off. People will say any garbage nonsense for attention on these TED talks.,1

11061,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why are we listening to &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; from a hot chick? Uh False Analogy much?,1
11062,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;i am insecure because i have to think about how i look every day&quot;<br><br>translation: almost everyone is insecure,1
11063,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Her opening statement about white privilege and the self loathing it induces in her is cringe worthy.  Modeling is a business! What&#39;s your point? You are a beautiful white woman modeling products to white america...of course there will be more white models in that segment of the modeling industry.  Thats not to say there aren&#39;t beautiful asians, blacks or latinas. Beautiful women of those races just dont feature predominantly because there are fewer of them here but go to other parts of the world and you will see whatever race pleases you. Cut the crap about this &quot;oh i won the lottery, im privileged, only 4% are non white&quot; blah blah blah. Yes you are beautiful and yes you won the lottery. Enjoy it. Take pride in it! Its not racist to model white women predominantly in middle class America. All this self loathing and guilt whites feel is so misplaced. All races have there most beautiful women...you happen to be white. Not your fault.",1
11064,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m part Indian and part European (white). Looks only matter for one or two occasions and then it&#39;s your abilities that will count.,1
11065,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything. As a model I will teach you how to want more and more. no limits of the greediness...,1
11066,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ms Russel Is teaching me some great ideas,1
11067,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol,1
11068,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The amount of Imature people in this comment section is sad.<br><br>She wasnt saying &quot;Looks arent everything personality matters&quot;.<br><br>She was saying Looks wont lead you to having high self esteem and that she is self aware of how her image is distorted lnto misleading people into having unrealistic exspectations of themselves.<br><br>Being Privledged doesnt remove her right to speak on this or shed light on the amount of distortion that has become the norm.<br><br>PS...she was breathing heavily because she was nervous to give this talk because she is aware of the bias people have against the privledged.<br><br>Anyone her who thinks that being pretty and having money is enough to create happiness need to get informed.,1
11069,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I didn&#39;t like this too much. She tried too hard to come to &quot;our level&quot; and perhaps appease our jealousy by showing pictures of her as &quot;normal-looking.&quot; Well, the fact is, you&#39;re beautiful on that stage right now and do not look too far off from those &quot;so unrealistic&quot; modeling photos you were presenting. Also, when challenging the idea of growing up to be a model, she gave very odd examples of what one could be instead. She said she was pretty enough to be a model (&quot;genetic lottery&quot;, &quot;[white] legacy&quot;), and so that&#39;s why she became a model. So it should go for anyone else, right? She should just outright say, &quot;If you&#39;re white and super-pretty, go for it!&quot; But like she said, she&#39;s in a very difficult position and it&#39;s hard to find a balance between discussing her obvious benefits of her looks and talking of insecurities..could easily lead to people detecting hypocrisy...which a lot of people are claiming.<br>Anyway, this video in no way changed my idea to &quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything.&quot;",1
11070,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,from the previous comment I can say &quot;you can give a knowledge to the person but you can&#39;t make them think.&quot;,1
11071,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;hey take it off!&quot;- someone should have said,1
11072,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is a fucking horrible. All she talked about was how great it was to get things from being good looking but that shes insecure bc shes good looking. Her looks are fading so now she&#39;s acknowledging it..,1
11073,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"think you for the inside in how you wonderful life look , oh sorry if you free stafe",1
11074,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A model talking about looks aren&#39;t everything is like a Junky saying Drugs aren&#39;t everything. Would you believe it !?,1
11075,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Im confused, isnt what she saying is looks is everything, every point she made is because of her looks",1
11076,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I am ashamed for all of the people who commented such horrible and hateful things about her. This was incredibly brave and honest. She was out of breathe and shaky because this was a scary thing to do. To go in front of a live and huge Internet audience and talk about her experience of white privilege is something that I would challenge many of the haters to try and do themselves. Our definition of beauty has become too one dimensional. We lost our individuality when it comes to what we personally perceive as beautiful. We rely on the media to spoon feed us what we are supposed to view as beautiful.,1
11077,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She didnt sin the genetics lottery. she is just one more. But her genetics are not si good. The face But not the body.,1
11078,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Now, let me put a smile on that face!",1
11079,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This wasn&#39;t worth watching. She basically told us a tiny, little bit about the model industry, that she has a great life because of her looks, yet still feels insecure while knowing she looks good and is also aware that other people are treated &quot;less than&quot; also because of their looks. Why make this video? How relevant is this talk considering that nothing can be done about your genetic put together and what it more than likely holds for your future? I say; &quot;no more of these please&quot;",1
11080,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Don&#39;t discriminate against people for looks. Hate everyone. :P,1
11081,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s so brave,1

11088,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good talk, though it will always bum me out when I see things like Ms. Russell having to give a defense for her speech. Because she&#39;s benefiting from the gender and racial legacies there is somehow this misguided belief that you are not allowed to be critical of it. It&#39;s the same sort of thing you can see on Tumblr every day. Dialogues like &quot;Black people are getting oppressed and we should help them!&quot; &quot;Shut up, you&#39;re white so your opinion doesn&#39;t matter.&quot; Shouldn&#39;t it be that if you&#39;re a part of the group that is getting the benefits of such a legacy that your opinion that it&#39;s wrong has just as much weight if not more?",1
11089,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t understand why people are so negative to one another. Just listen when someone is moved profoundly enough by something in this  world to speak about it. Why do people feel so entitled to comment on everyone&#39;s opinion? Just let it be.  It&#39;s difficult to tolerate the intolerant.,1
11090,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,did she just say u have to be white to be a model?,1
11091,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"vermutlich wird wohl jedes uere bewertet, ohne nach Innen zu schauen - und das ist wohl meistens falsch - bei gut aussehenden Menschen genau so wie bei nicht so gut aussehenden. Dann gleich es sich ja wieder aus. Die Fotogegenberstellungen waren ja wirklich krass.",1

11093,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A lot of you guys are missing the point of her Talk. Now, of course, she doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be ugly, she understands that. She doesn&#39;t have the experience of being ugly so that&#39;s why you bash on her. Understand her perspective. She knows she gets free things in life because of her beauty. She <b>Gives</b> you her experiences, but she&#39;s still here talking about how Looks Aren&#39;t Everything? Blasphemy! Re-read the line: Looks Aren&#39;t Everything. She talks about her insecurities and how she isn&#39;t happy. It&#39;s the same as winning the lottery or being rich, there are happy/sad poor people and happy/sad rich people. Oh look! she includes a picture of a lottery winner. If you Try to understand what she&#39;s saying, it is that your life won&#39;t be fulfilled because you&#39;re good looking.",1

But when you are pretty people want to help you, it is a huge power to be good-looking and it&#39;s a drug.",1
11097,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The point she is coming across is how men and women behave unusual around those they wish to become, like when they interact with a model of her status; it would be frustrating when people think your looks are your only strength and it is only useful for one thing, when your potential is so much greater. Whats interesting is she has no more pride over her looks as one would over the color of their eye or their skin. That says a lot about her integrity. The character of a great leader.",1

Human females narrow their waists when ovulating (the muscles and blood flow change) and when they&#39;re aroused; their lips expand and become deeper in color.<br><br>I do not understand why women are naturally attracted to darker men and men are naturally attracted to lighter women.  It doesn&#39;t make biological sense, yet it transcends across cultures.

11116,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t get it. If she hates the model industry so much, why doesn&#39;t she quit. Than I&#39;ll take her seriously. Because right now, she is just a model who gets paid to show off her &quot;beauty&quot; and making everyone else feel insecure. And she knows that too. She is both taking part in this awful industry and fighting it. But that is not possible and not credible.

My bestfriend is quite good-looking but her personality is just as normal as any of my friends. Yet, the boys always pay attention to her, ask her to go out and are constantly eager to help her, whereas my other friend is left out just because she&#39;s not as pretty. I&#39;m not going to blame the boys, because they do like pretty girls. So, it&#39;s so sad that because I didn&#39;t win the &quot;genetic lottery,&quot; I have way less opportunities in social life. I try, but.. looks do outweigh certain things.",1

11135,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I honestly don&#39;t believe that this is just white privilege. I have a good friend who is one of those classic beauties, but she isn&#39;t white. She floats through life with no worries because men naturally always want to do things for her. She is adorably clueless and has no idea how others can be scared to take big risks financially or professionally because she always has someone who is going to come to her rescue. She thinks all of the good things that come to her are because of her hard work and intelligence,  when it&#39;s really just her striking beauty.  Sometimes it&#39;s fun to be with her because you can also benefit vicariously from her good fortune, but most of the time it&#39;s frustrating because you realize that it&#39;s fleeting. Looks will get you much further in life than talent. Just look at all the talented people who never make it on American Idol, or how many middle-age men are on wife #2, who is usually 10 or 15 years younger.",1

At the root of the problem is our corporate culture, our misguided and misguiding ideas about the blessings of capitalism. <br><br>Billions of dollars are spent on advertising to manipulate us into buying stuff. Two of the most effective techniques is to either create associations that trigger desire (such as planting in our subconcious the idea that drinking lots of Coke would surround you with impossibly perfect people who think you are the coolest person ever) or to make us feel really dissatisfied with ourselves - so we&#39;ll buy products we hope will make us look &quot;better&quot;.<br><br>Ever noticed how the very same companies that sell creams to give you &quot;golden, glowing skin&quot; in North America and Europe sell very similar products, but with opposite effect, in markets where most people already have golden skin? It turns out if you turn manipulation into a science - which is what modern consumer marketing is! - you can convince everyone that the way they look is not desireable, and sell them a ton of stuff. <br><br>Basically, it&#39;s not a coincidence that the beauty image that is being pushed will make most people feel bad.

11180,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Modeling and what captures the audience is actually RAW REALITY of what people desire.

What people attract to is their actual person. Young thin models have never appealed to me at all because I love a fuller grown woman.

11232,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fun fact: being ugly is good. You know that people like you for your personality then,1
11233,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this video is letting you know that you can be anything you want to be. just put yourmind to it and do it. just to let you knowbeing a model is hard work. so just be happy in what ever you want to do .,1

I&#39;m a little confused by the opening too.  She didn&#39;t transform what I thought of her in 6 seconds.  She was a beautiful woman in a short black dress, then she was a beautiful woman in a long skirt and tight sweater.",1

11247,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I agree Image can be powerful and image can be superficial but it doesnt make valuable us or it doesnt make worthness.Appearance isnt everything.,1
11248,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, one of the very few models to use her occupation as a model to send out a message that a lot understand, but don&#39;t speak about. My hat goes off to her.",1

11250,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"At first I was so anti this talk, but she really turned me around. It ended up becoming very interesting. We are so obsessed with the image, instead of the core.",1
11251,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she treads a line she is uncomfortable with in this talk. She says herself at the end; she was torn between saying that she enjoys her work, and acknowledging she is the willing recipient of privilege where there are obvious and serious losers at the opposite end of the scale. <br><br>On a deep level, what can Russell enjoy about her work? She is not contributing in a meaningful way to society, she is not helping, she is not redistributing wealth. Instead she is merely perpetuating a cycle that deems superficial traits to be the most important currency.<br><br>Russell is part of the problem I&#39;m afraid. To those saying good for her in speaking about it. I would say good for her in coming to this realisation in a society that teaches you that fame, wealth, and looks are tickets to happiness. But having come to this realisation, I think speaking about it in this rather muted fashion and then going back to live under the rock she is condemning is frankly, her doing the bare minimum. It&#39;s like somebody saying &#39;Child labour is wrong&#39; and continuing to buy Nike shoes at every new release.<br><br>Until she removes herself from an industry that has a negative impact on society, but in particular, young girls, she is still part of the problem. And more locally, until she pursues a cause with a more altruistic base, she will remain ruled by the egoic stimulus of being a model, one that leaves you unhappy and insecure.",1
11252,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t understand why some people here are so ignorant of the main point of this passage. Yes, she is talking about how pretty she is and privileged she has become because of her looks, but she is looking at all of this objectively. It&#39;s frustrating to think that people are taking the former independent clause as the main point of this TED talk rather than thinking that these are her supporting ideas. The main points that I gleamed from this were the biases and superficiality of the fashion industry and how it affects her life as well as others.  It&#39;s just puzzling.",1

She&#39;s basically saying she&#39;s ashamed to be a model because it&#39;s shallow, low-intelligence work (even though she continues to do it).   <br><br>Cameron is a hypocrite.

I walk through school and see these girls who are skinny, tall, and looks like goddesses. But seeing this really does make me think, how much effort those girl put into their everyday appearance. Society paints pretty as skinny with shiny hair and beautiful skin. But having someone, who is actually in the field of modeling, talk about this, it really does instill some self-confidence.",1

11265,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love how sometimes people will try to make a talking point to you but spend so much time focused on the surrounding material that they just come across as assholes.

11266,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I have a lot of respect for her giving this talk. Because yes, while on the one hand, she &quot;won the genetic lottery&quot;, so to speak. So she&#39;s able to be a model and get paid for it, and she has gotten free things just for being pretty. But on the other hand, she was &quot;scouted&quot; and turned in to a model before she even had her first menstrual period. Before she was even close to being old enough to understand what she was getting in to. And now, as she said, there are many instances in which people don&#39;t take her seriously because of it. So she&#39;s fawned over and paid for modeling and being pretty. But at the same time, she was never given the change to be anything different. How many people will take her seriously if she publicly embarks on any intellectual endeavors? I honestly don&#39;t know. But the decision was made by others to objectify and sexualize her before she was old enough to understand the repercussions, and that&#39;s what I don&#39;t like. Make no mistake, if she had made the decision to get into this industry on her own as an adult, I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with it. But she was sort of shoved into it, and now some of her choices are really limited.",1

11270,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Women objectify themselves through the fashion and cosmetic industry that is run by them. Not only with the fake, touched up, half-naked images blasted across the covers of womens&#39; magazines, but all the useless garbage in print inside. If superficiality is a concern for young girls bombarded by certain mediums, maybe Vogue writers could start writing articles on how to become a surgeon, how to invest in the stock market and the importance of engineering in society.",1

11272,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am apparently a handsome guy and have been told so couple of times. However, unlike guys women will very rarely state to your face they find you attractive but will instead compliment a feature which with me is usually my eyes or my smile. I also notice that I do get checked out by women now and again. Nevertheless the privilege of being a good looking woman far outweighs being a good looking guy. Why? Because women do NOT place that much emphasis on looks and their concept of what is deemed attractive is extremely diverse. Instead confidence and personality is the real game changer. Admittedly looks helps to get you through the door but if you have no personality and lack confidence women will instantly deem them unworthy of their attentions. I know of so many good looking guys who struggle to get women purely because they have zero charm yet because us guys are more physical creatures as long as she looks hot we can overlook certain personality flaws to get what we want.",1
11273,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The industry needs to go back to hiring women over 20 NOT children. Ever since runway gained fame we have had eating disorders soar and bad ideals sold to women. Before runway women of all heights and shapes modeled. They were not obese, anorexic or overweight. Their faces were nice and the clothes were better too. The stupid myths the fashion world send out need to be exposed.<br>This industry is nothing but an escort service and trafficking industry.<br>Go back to hiring women for their faces and only those who are healthy. Don&#39;t photoshop them and stop the ageism. They sexualize children then claim they aim their clothes to grown women.<br>Use women older than 20 and let them model for life! <br><br>The industry is always being exposed in one way or another but people just don&#39;t pay attention. We have a celebrity worshipping culture now because people follow untalented people!<br>Looks do not matter however you will be treated differently if you are deemed attractive.

11278,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
11279,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;In a county where the majority of people -- especially with wealth -- are white, models are skinny white women. We&#39;re oppressing minorities!

How many white people are in China? Not many.<br><br>You stupid moron. No one is being oppressed by the fact that North American models are usually skinny white women. I notice you only claimed it oppressed minorities, but you left out fat men and people missing limbs.<br><br>You horrible oppressive shitlord!<br><br>Gah, SJWs are everywhere. Horrible.",1

11289,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel catfished I came expecting this talk to be in French since the title was also in French,1
11290,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Interesting talk but one thing had me raise an eye. At the end she says &quot;it was difficult to unpack gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries&quot;<br>I think the wording there shows insight to the feminist mindset. She did not say &quot;gender and racial bias&quot; she used the word &quot;oppression&quot; and when she says gender we know she means female oppression. So her privilege is actually the result of female oppression in her eyes and this is significant because when feminists talk about patriarchy they include all the privileges that women get as more examples of their oppression. This means even if we treat women perfectly equal any difference in gender roles is still viewed as a negative, including, for example, keeping women out of the draft. As a recent feminist said &quot;war hurts women the most because they become widows and single parents&quot;. So when you have an ideology that classes female privileges as female oppression, then by definition we will never satisfy feminism because men and women are objectively different and will never be treated exactly the same in every way. <br>But it is worse than that, feminists are fighting for privilege anyway, they don&#39;t want any of the negative things pure equality brings, no one is fighting for female models to get paid less like male models, no one is fighting for women to work in the mines in equal numbers as men yet numbers of female CEO&#39;s are important. Feminists are fighting a battle that can either never be won or if it can be won it will only be when women are more privileged than men in every single aspect of life.",1
11291,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Anyone criticizing this is just a jealous and/or uncomfortable acknowledging you are the same as her and have the same judgements as us all.  She&#39;s just educating people by bringing awareness to how limited our perception is due to constructed images of individuals along with racial hierarchy/profiling. She is not saying she has identified a new problem or is helping to &quot;solve&quot; it. Just acknowledging the issue. Clearly she is well aware of her own position and how she is &quot;contributing&quot; to the &quot;issue&quot; if by that you mean she looks how she looks, dresses how she is dressed,  and gets paid for changing it. She is absolutely credible as she is an industry professional bringing awareness to how we judge others and gain or lose opportunities and benefits based on appearances.",1
11292,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t think model is a permanent career because of high requirement about your physical appearance. The beauty will be fade when the aging come and they are no longer on top of success, several models after the age of 30 are unemployment. Thus, the value of inside soul and content are more important at that time.",1

Don&#39;t tell everyone else to be ashamed.<br><br>The resources she has got because of her DNA are not a human right for her or anyone else.<br><br>Does Naomi Campbell get resources because of her DNA? <br><br>But she is not white?<br><br>This is odd it&#39;s like this model has no idea what she is talking about other than her own crappy emotions.<br><br>Well done TED another model asking for world peace.<br><br>Jesus",1
11306,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Intelligence or personality isn&#39;t everything either.<br>Money is everything.,1
11307,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ye people dont like people who arent pretty people have bern laughing at me from the time i remember only coz of my big flat nose theyre still hurting me till this very day at age  53,1
11308,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ITS NOT A PRIVILEGE IT&#39;S A RIGHT,1
11309,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,well shes pretty attractive.. ?,1
11310,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"es cierto, es realmente terrible cmo una vez que dijo &quot;soy modelo&quot; y vi su foto mi primer pensamiento fue que era estpida y no tendra nada interesante para contar. Creo que es muy loable que, como ella misma dice, estando en un lugar extremadamente beneficiario de un sistema discriminatorio, se pare ah y diga: &quot;no est bien&quot;. Para alguien que vive de su imagen, que tiene las inseguridades que confiesa, y que est en una industria en que todo es ficcin, decir la verdad, ser honesta y reconocer de manera cruda sus aciertos y sus fallas es un acto de gran valenta. Buena charla, me parece.",1
11311,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The problem with this ted talk is that she after this ted talk, will go to a shoot and continue being part of the problem: the problem being the way the media is constantly telling girls to not feel pretty. She is not credible.. She realizes what her work as a model is doing to other people&#39;s confidence, talking about it, and then being a complete hypocrite to actually continue being a pretty, flawless model.",1
11312,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,did she  sayin only white people are beautyfull please black woman are better,1
11313,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,young girls should see this video,1
11314,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,so the point was...?,1
11315,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The advantages of being white are more profound than most white people know. But most white people only know other white people, so they don&#39;t see it. I never understood it until I travelled to Egypt. I was absolutely floored by the number of TV advertisements I saw for &quot;skin whitening&quot; cream on every channel. Literally every second or third ad was for that.",1
11316,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Money isn&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a banker",1
11317,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m a young model and it&#39;s crazy to me how these beautiful woman are so insecure with their body image. I was watching this video because I was doing my research for fun about the industry (even though I know the truth), and it find it so interesting. I&#39;m sitting here on my laptop right now looking at this gorgeous woman. I&#39;m looking at her modelling photos and comparing them to mine. I want to get tips and tricks and apply it to my photos. I am looking at my phone camera to see how I looked while watching this video. When she said she feels insecure, I felt relieved. I felt relieved that a gorgeous woman like her can teach me a valuable lesson on loving yourself. She feels insecure with her looks even though she is absolutely stunning in her photos. I feel insecure as ever sometimes and then people tell me &quot;be quiet, you&#39;re a model you&#39;re gorgeous&quot;. But that doesn&#39;t stop me from thinking negatively about myself. As a young model I WANT to have pictures that look like professional models, I practice my posing to make sure I won&#39;t be disappointed when I see the results. I&#39;m glad to know that I&#39;m not the only person who gets complimented on their looks yet still feels ugly as ever sometimes. It&#39;s a good feeling to know that I&#39;m not the only individual who feels pressured by society. But in the end, I have come to realize that the importance that I put on others viewing my appearance is why too high. If a gorgeous, successful, model can look at themselves negatively after hearing &quot;you&#39;re face and body are a work of art&quot;, it just goes to show you that the way you view another individual&#39;s appearance isn&#39;t the way they view themselves. AND THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD NOT COMPARE OURSELVES TO OTHERS! You may want to look like someone and have their physique because you are so infatuated with their appearance, yet that person doesn&#39;t think that way about themselves and is thinking like you are and comparing themselves to someone else. Obviously I&#39;m still going to have some insecure days, but I need to remember this comment that I&#39;m writing because it&#39;s helping me get a better understanding about reality. It&#39;s crazy how important a perspective is, and watching this video really changed my thoughts.<br><br><br>Love yourself, please.",1
11318,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What funny is that everything she said was true. What you see in the media isn&#39;t true beauty it&#39;s processed and artificial and superficial.,1
11319,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I like what she said because she was honest about who she was and who she worked for.,1
11320,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A beautiful brain in a beautiful body. Jackpot.,1
11321,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A woman can find her true worth in Christ Jesus. Only accept Jesus as Lord and personal Saviour, and your value will be incomparable. God bless all women!",1
11322,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,One of my favourite Ted Talks,1
11323,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I applaud her courage and brilliance.,1
11324,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,your honestly means a lot!,1
11325,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow .. this model blowed my mind off :),1
11326,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Dear God... I mean, really? Talk about some self-hate",1
11327,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great talk, now take off your top",1
11328,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I really didn&#39;t expect she would talk about racism, i mean ...wooow...A white mannequin acknowledging it and saying it publicly....any backlash since i guess &quot;looool&quot;",1
11329,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she made some valuable,  detailed points which are often overlooked.  She seems humble and sincere about her message. In exposing the biases it gets us all thinking; it&#39;s like a bare wound, it heals with time. ",1
11330,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Better that it comes from her I guess. It may seem a bit condescending, but shes not stating it out of conflict of interest",1
11331,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She googled a couple of random stats, and told us she&#39;s insecure. How is this a TED talk?",1
11332,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So refreshingly honest.,1
11333,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I just watched this ted talk last week and I can only conclude that if she feels the fashion industry is so superficial then its time for her to find another profession. I am sure that she has earned enough money during her career for her leave the industry behind if she feels it doesn&#39;t fit with her ideals. Can&#39;t help but think that by doing this talk she is biting the hand that has fed her.,1
11334,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The world really needed this message. I&#39;m applaud her courage for delivering it,1
11335,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she just got more beautiful on the fact that she is beautiful on the inside aswell,1
11336,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If she&#39;s so guilty about the way she looks, she should get surgery to make herself less attractive. But I&#39;m sure that isn&#39;t an option for her.",1
11337,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Misleading title. It&#39;d be like Donald Trump coming out and saying &quot;Money isn&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a billionaire.&quot;<br><br>Looks matter a lot in this society.<br>I get she&#39;s acknowledging her privilege, and I&#39;m not hating her for that, but saying looks doesn&#39;t equal happiness isn&#39;t going to change how ugly people are treated. And it&#39;s not just a problem with young girls, guys are also very much judged by how they look in this day and age. In fact some studies have shown that looks can positively or negatively effect men even more than women in the workforce (ie. more likely to get hired / promoted if they are tall and handsome and much more likely to get passed up if they are ugly).",1
11338,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love her.,1
11339,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This video is outstanding, especially that you drew attention to how many youth feel unhappy with their bodies and the social discrimination against minorities.",1
11340,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This video shows that she isn&#39;t just a beautiful girl, she has also got a beautiful courageous mind and of course brains.",1
11341,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Empty head,1
11342,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She basically proved that looks are everything,1
11343,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,1) Looks really arent everything<br>2) Modeling isnt as cool as it looks<br>3) Pictures dont show the truth<br>4) Models are very insecure about their bodies<br>5) Its not a good career path as u might think<br>6) Delusional about career path,1
11344,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Itoo discovered that looks aren&#39;t everything, I had to develop a great character as well in order totruly feel better than everyone else. I also learnedthe value ofmodestyin order to put inferiors at ease. Very good talk.",1
11345,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot; I won the genetic lottery&quot; very good line,1
11346,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sorry to contradict, but looks actually ARE everything. I learned it the hard way during my school years and i did major changes since then. People are extremely mean and cruel and they will make fun of you for basically anything. Don&#39;t buy the the bullsh*t with &quot;looks don&#39;t matter&quot;, improve your looks.",1
11347,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t think we learnt much from this talk. Models are insecure and get free stuff and some of them feel awkward about it. Wow! Ironically a very superficial talk.,1
11348,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is so stupid and topics like this. I personally like short petite women and what&#39;s attractive to me is just is. It&#39;s not programmed in me . Just like I knew when I was 7 I liked girls. I wasn&#39;t programmed . So dumb!!,1
11349,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i love god and all but the humans race needed a god to avenge them. not some one that agrees with sacraficeing as of sadom and gammora.i want are rock back. for what is the gole of life with out a home ?,1
11350,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I was pretty much sure from the caption of the video that she is gonna say the exact thing what she shared with us in this video and she just rocked, message was so clear and precise, thumbs up!",1
11351,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great speech. Very mind opening.,1
11352,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I like this kid. Her defensive chuckles are like those of Jacob Barnett and endearing.<br>Kid?? A standout young woman,",1
11353,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s true I&#39;m a model, and all the things she says are right, I have to think about how i look all the time and it does make you so so insecure. /: yet saying it makes you feel bad cuz your profiting from how you look.",1
11354,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a joke. Its the obscene rich telling the dirt poor that money and material possessions arent so important...if looks aren&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t be so important then why does she have super well kept long hair? Look at some female scientists. They could be very good looking too but they dont really care a lot about how they wear or treat their hair or how their figure exactly looks like.<br><br>Don&#39;t tell me this woman doesn&#39;t exactly controls what she eats and how she works out. A &quot;normal&quot; woman her age does NOT look like that. If she wasn&#39;t as obsessed as everybody else about her looks and the giant advantages she gets from them she would at least weight 10-15 kilos more.,1
11355,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think you are a wonderful person, intelligent, honest, upright and really inspiring. My regards to you and not your image..GOD bless you.",1
11356,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Aww she&#39;s insecure although everyone will be treating her nicely and she&#39;ll find a rich husband with the snap of a finger:(,1
11357,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,good,1
11358,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I got the impression she hated herself but kept watching because she&#39;s pretty.,1
11359,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wonder if she regrets becoming a model. Because it seems like she&#39;s way too smart to be one.,1
11360,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; and &quot;money doesn&#39;t buy happiness&quot; are two expressions that should go hand in hand. The people that are able to express those sentiments with such conviction, are unable to put themselves on the position of those who lack those attributes.",1
11361,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m still baffled at how they were able to make her look like that in the first picture comparison,1
11362,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow how to be delusional....we are responsable for the image we project to other people....dont blame the television or the magazines...its being hypocrite,1
11363,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is absolutely amazing talk. Thank you for inspiration and for making things a bit easier:),1
11364,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fantastic! I had never heard about being a model from that perspective. Smart lady.,1
11365,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Only a model can say looks aren&#39;t important, just like only a billionaire can say that money doesn&#39;t matter. These things matter if you don&#39;t have them. ",1
11366,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love her attitude :D,1
11367,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love that she brought up pretty privilege and most importantly WHITE PRIVILEGE.  Not a lot of white folk are aware it exists or don&#39;t want to admit it. Bravo pretty intelligent model lady!,1
11368,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Powerful speech. I loved and I&#39;m surprised because what she has said is true. I hope one day we can look people how they really are. Doesn&#39;t matter your size, your color, your hair or your nose. What is important is who you are and what you do in your life.",1
11369,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautifully inspiring...! Thank you for sharing a piece of your world. :),1
11370,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,When and where is Cameron&#39;s &quot;pity party&quot; going to be held?,1
11371,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"well, Ms.Russell... I wasn&#39;t expecting to cry. beyond the courage of your words, there is an unmistakably DEEP reservoir of self-knowledge; and a little goofiness! it&#39;s true I think you&#39;re very beautiful, but infinitely more so after <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=9m37s"">9:37</a> seconds. On a far less dramatic scale, I&#39;ve been struggling with some of the points you mentioned, and just... thank you for sharing your light on my way. namaste~ the light in me honors the light in you :)",1
11372,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Total transformation?? She went from stunning to stunning!! Didn&#39;t work for me..,1
11373,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Gist of Cameron&#39;s talk:<br>1. I won the genetic lottery. Beautiful, tall, slender, and white.<br>2. I&#39;ve benefitted greatly from the model industry despite my misgivings.<br>3. I&#39;ve received special attention because of my looks.<br>4. Looks aren&#39;t everything.<br><br>Are we supposed to have a pity party for you???<br>Are we supposed to have a telethon to raise money to help all the beautiful, tall, slender white women whom have won the &quot;genetic lottery&quot; with low self esteem?<br>This is like hearing a talk from Bill Gates talking about how being rich is not important. Right message/Wrong messenger.",1
11374,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I personally am very proud of the girl on stage. Even though i am just 11 and not supper thin or supper pretty. I admit i do get jealous of some girls. I would like to give a shoutout to all girls and boys who feel the same way as me. And i believe that EVERYONE can be happy, through modeling or not.",1
11375,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Excellent talk. She is beautiful but has self esteem issues. She is aware of white privilege but also aware of others that don&#39;t have that same advantage. Very interesting talk. Believing in YOUR beauty is what counts. Bravo, Cameron!",1
11376,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow that was amazing, thank you so much for that! It played automatically after watching a video saying &#39;we are all great.&#39; Everysingle person has their own worries and it is important to remember that what ever front is being shown, inside, there is a delicate person with hopes, dreams and aspirations. Even if that person is as hard as nails, as pretty as a picture, as wise as an owl... deep down, they are just human! Have a good day!",1
11377,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I guess it&#39;s just human nature to envy the beautiful and successful. Even though they are privelaged by chance the common people will always have bitter feelings towards them.,1
11378,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
11379,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This woman is infected with the disease of retarded brain which helps her nourish a bunch Marxist white guilt.,1
11380,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beautiful, smart and eloquent. Gasping a lot makes her sexy :D",1
11381,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Killer expression of self. Thank you!!!!!! Cameron,1
11382,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m amaze at how many people don&#39;t understand how much your life is easier when you are beautiful. It doesn&#39;t just affect your chance to have a career in the beauty industry but in everything from social interactions to applying for something as mundane as a desk job. Statistics show that beautiful people succeed more than average or ugly people in every jobs. They also tend to have a better social life because people react nicely instinctively to them. Then in turn they develop confidence and go farther in life. This is a well documented phenomena it&#39;s called : The halo effect.<br><br>When someone who had it easier than the average jane or joe goes on crying that it was not that fair, i have only one thing to reply: SCREW YOU!!!",1
11383,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron, you are a very honest and thoughtful young lady.",1
11384,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Funny to see this, my mother was a model for 30 years and she told me how she came into a hotel once with the other models and the owner of the hotel walks up to them all mad, &quot;You can&#39;t sit at these seats, they are reserved for the models!&quot; On which they respond Sorry, we are the models and he didn&#39;t believe it till the next day where they were all in make-up and ready for the photo shoots. Nice video :)",1
11385,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That&#39;s one smart lady!,1
11386,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There are a few huge downsides that come along with being beautiful. Beautiful people mainly feel insecure because they don&#39;t know what it feels like to have a genuine business contact or acquaintance. It is extremely disheartening when you receive praise or any extra attention from society, and you know it&#39;s only because the person thought you were pretty. How do we know? Because you can tell when somebody only wants to sleep with you. Sure, it gets you noticed, but nobody takes you seriously outside of being pretty. Not to mention all of the hate you get from other women.",1
11387,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So, she&#39;s a <b>victim</b> because she&#39;s pretty?!?!?!?<br><br>The Victim Status Continuum has shifted to the absurd yet again!",1
11388,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The problem is unavoidable, and there&#39;s no solution other than for the fashion industry and the entertainment industry to change what is considered attractive to something other than someone like her. As we know, thin women weren&#39;t always considered the peak of beauty. She was fortunate in both genes AND time period. Born several hundred years ago she might be viewed as fugly. I also have noticed that nerdy guys get a little bit more play than when I was a kid thanks to the glorification of nerd-dom in the post-internet age. My take-away is to understand that it is all luck and timing, so don&#39;t sweat how I turned out so much. Just focus on something else and make due with the cards I was dealt. My parents were wise to instill in me the basic concept &quot;life isn&#39;t fair&quot;. Once you embrace it, it&#39;s easier to be happy.",1
11389,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,hipocracy,1
11390,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,that must have taken so much bravery and courage. wow.,1
11391,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are cool Cameron R.,1
11392,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;ve had two VERY good-looking girlfriends in the past, and they definitely live in a different world. Everywhere we went, men fell all over themselves to do anything they could to gain their attention and favor. One girlfriend forgot her debit card, and got free gas. The other got employment pretty much anywhere she wanted, despite being vastly under qualified. And these are just two examples of the dozens of situations I saw while dating each of them.  The world fell at their feet, because of their beauty.",1
11393,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Easy to say. You&#39;re a model.,1
11394,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I want u.s citizens to know that there are white latinos, there are blonde, red head latinos,There are extremely pale latinos. There are european latinos that look exactly like white European people do because some of us are white. Stop putting all latinos in the same bag. It is really annoying. It is not like when you say &quot;black people&quot;, which they all have in common dark skin and curly hair. Asians aren&#39;t just chinese and Japanese people. Indians are Asians too. Most asians(in china,Japan,Indonesia) have black straight hair and small eyes. But latino&#39;s countries are all extremely different from another. People usually think I am Russian and I am not.",1
11395,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Omg I SOOO get this.... She&#39;s trying to convey a message: that she wants to be identified by who she is inside and not outside,1
11396,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good on ya Cameron. A really cool perspective on what life is really much more like in real life without the glamor filter on! This took some courage to do.,1
11397,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s interesting how she wants us to change our perception of what&#39;s beautiful and marketable according to race, gender and superficiality and yet she made it into the top 10 view count of Ted Talks because she is a &#39;sexy, white woman&#39;. It&#39;s not a &quot;great&quot; Ted Talk, but the irony of her 6 million views could not support her argument better.",1
11398,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its sad..I&#39;m going through alot with my 14 yr old step daughter.. Every mirror she walks by she has to look in..every time she eats she only eats half...she has to change her clothes at least a min of four times a day..and no matter how many times I say you are beautiful the way you are..it will never sink in due to the &quot;image&quot; society we live in..it kills me...when I was a young man I used to feed off of women&#39;s insecurities.. And now I&#39;m trying to protect a young women everyday from her own insecurities... It kills me I can&#39;t..but I&#39;ll never give up...,1
11399,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, I can like actually feel her nerves through my computer screen. That&#39;s crazy.",1
11400,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this was like a Taylor Swift song... white girl problems. Shut up, take the dress off, and more pictures in your underwear.",1
11401,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,u say white,1
11402,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Being ugly is when you notice how people act. Almost no people at all are nice towards real ugly people. that&#39;s a fact.,1
11403,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Respect.,1
11404,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This video is against Islam and prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Such immodesty insults the religious sentiments of those who follow the path of righteousness.",1
11405,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah I woud love to model, but the industry is brutal.",1
11406,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i dont get the model industry. ive seen alot better looking people that most models ive seen. how are they picking them?,1
11407,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I gained an amazing insight into something that I usually don&#39;t think about!,1
11408,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is an absolutely beautiful speech. Many people are judging your looks and missing the point. Which is... models are some of the most insecure people on the planet because they are forced to worry about what they look like everyday. Yet, millions of girls all over the world want to be you. I think you gave sound advice and the clothing change at the beginning really proved your point!  ",1
11409,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s beautiful, she&#39;s smart, she need a gentleman like me to take care her!",1
11410,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I still don&#39;t understand how she&#39;s managed to deliver the point in the video&#39;s title.,1
11411,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The stats of only 4% of models being none white is really specific to that region. If that study was conducted in my area they would find less than 20% of models are white, because white people are the minority.",1
11412,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol. She certainly proves what naive airheads models are.,1
11413,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Its so funny how pple are so dumb. In this nude-obsessed world, they would just let some person be naked all over. Might as well just let everyone be naked. Whats the diff? I like that shes being honest but really &quot;not my image.&quot; At least some parts have to be hers like her tallness and chest- duh. And of course- the men always love to stare while the females pretend nothings happening. Thats how this society rules- pretend nothings happening &amp; ignore it. No wonder there are so many hubs into PlayBoy lol. ",1
11414,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, such an inspirational talk. It taught me that even though beauty is above all in our society today, that it is still superficial. I never knew that even if you are what the standard of &quot;flawless&quot; would be that you still have insecurities like every other person; it&#39;s only human. And being in the public eye can make these insecurities worsen because you know everybody is judging you and your imperfections. Beauty is only skin deep",1
11415,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she is amazing,1
11416,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She seems like a nice girl,1
11417,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This talk turned out to be a pleasant surprise!,1
11418,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is so dumb. It&#39;s like a rich person saying that money isn&#39;t everything. You&#39;re still privileged over the most people and in the Western world looks are pretty fucking important which we can all conclude from the sheer fact that beauty standards are daily shoved in our faces. You&#39;re lying to yourself.,1
11419,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I saw the Lizzie Velasquez TED talk before I came here. I also recommend it.,1
11420,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Latinos have not gotten the memo because we like voluptuous women. As for people criticizing her for taking advantage of her opportunities...I think she should take advantage of them because she is using her power for something good and powerful. Think about us. Men take advantage of being men all the time. We get paid more than women and we usually dont think about that and say, maybe we shouldn&#39;t get that raise because we are taking advantage of being men.",1
11421,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,nice talk. thank you.,1
11422,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you so much! ,1
11423,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,the best way to keep young girls from becoming future models is to convince them that they&#39;re ugly. period.,1
11424,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"As a minority, I don&#39;t  need to hear this message  from her. We&#39;ve been living  this reality, already. <br><br>Seems like she really wanted to do a &quot;Ted talk&quot;",1
11425,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is one of my favorite TEDTalks.,1
11426,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"lol what was that whole ridiculous change of clothes display in the beginning supposed to prove? She went from being a super hot freak-of-nature skinny chick wearing a mini skirt and heals to being a super hot freak-of-nature skinny chick wearing a more conservative outfit. Wow, color me impressed. Look everyone, in spite of her attractiveness she&#39;s just like the rest of us mortal plebes!<br><br>While I do appreciate her candidness and objectivity when talking about this subject looking the way she does her whole &quot;don&#39;t judge me by my looks&quot; thing hardly seems genuine. I&#39;m sure for the most part she&#39;d like to believe that but probably has no problem ignoring that decree when it becomes convenient for her to gain an advantage. When it comes to dating for instance, I highly doubt she thinks her looks shouldn&#39;t matter when selecting a mate. Her looks will end up being the main factor determining which guy is eligible to date her. And since her attractiveness level is so high she will have the pick of the liter.<br><br>For example, If you&#39;ve ever been on any online dating site you&#39;ve probably seen guys who complain that they are not getting any responses. And what is the #1 guaranteed reply they will get? &quot;You must have too high of standards. You are probably trying to contact women who are <b>out of your league</b>, you are a 4 (or whatever low number) and you can&#39;t expect 8, 9&#39;s, and 10&#39;s to reply to you. <b>They are out of your league</b>&quot;. Well if you can&#39;t judge a person by the way they look then how can a league system exist that would preclude you from access to dating someone before you&#39;ve had a chance to know the person???? In other words, the &quot;league&quot; (aka is your looks comparable to hers...unless you&#39;re rich) is a precursor to whether or not you are even qualified to talk to the person in the first place...THE GETTING TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE ON THE INSIDE CAN ONLY HAPPEN <b>AFTER</b> THAT....So you are a 4 and you should KNOW better than to even think a 10 would talk to you...you should try to talk to other women in your own <b>league</b>...ie, someone who is also a 4. This is all based on looks alone.<br><br>I&#39;ll tell you nothing will bring down the wrath of righteous indignation more than hot chicks talking about men who failed to abide by this unwritten league rule and who tried to talk to them anyway. The code word they use to describe these men is &quot;CREEPS&quot;.<br><br>You can&#39;t have it both ways. Looks either matter (personally believe they matter the most) or they don&#39;t. Either choice will bring inconveniences.",1
11427,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I buy it.,1
11428,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good thing this ex-model isn&#39;t in charge of the police force. Crime would skyrocket as a result with this retarded philosophy that white female models aren&#39;t stopped enough or as often as averagehigh risk minoritymales in unsafe neighborhoods. I mean how much public safety is at risk by a 100lbwalking femaletwig in their underwear.,1
11429,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thanks for truth!,1
11430,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Cameron unpacked several important topics. Good start.,1
11431,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There are many good-looking people in the world, both men and women. I am one of a hundred of good-looking people. And everyone good-looking people do know that looks &#39;can&#39; be everything if you focus on it. She is a pretty white woman but that does not mean she has to &#39;show off&#39; that she has a superior quality to her. I think she just wanted to prove herself better by becoming a model and speaking on TED.",1
11432,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She kind of has a man face, though.",1
11433,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hey, another TED talk on white guilt! Not sure how that is an &quot;Ideas Worth Spreading&quot;.<br><br>As for her comments on stop and frisk, let me use an analogy: Everyone knows cycling has a huge doping problem, but in order for the cyclists not to feel discriminated against, they should do equal amounts of testing amongst cyclists and chess players, or simply stop testing cyclists. Now, one would say that both these scenarios are ridiculous, but this is exactly the logic being applied to stop and frisk.",1
11434,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What I got from this after not even thinking hard because it&#39;s literally what she&#39;s saying but some people overthink things too much and are ignorant: She was genetically gifted, praised, things were handed to her when she thinks/knows she didn&#39;t earn it, wondered why, and that looks aren&#39;t everything. We shouldn&#39;t worry about looks so much. There&#39;s way more to life. Sure looks are freakin&#39; amazing to have, but we shouldn&#39;t be focused on it so much as to where we&#39;re not comfortable with ourselves. Be confident. She apologizes for her career, and how fucked society is. Sure, she&#39;s a model, but that&#39;s not who &quot;she&quot; is, you know. Everybody somehow misses this point. Also, funny how people are saying she&#39;s conceited. Are you fuckin&#39; kidding me...Morons.",1
11435,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t understand her ultimate conclusion. If she chose to go and live in Africa she would probably be the target of racism everyday, being the minority. Only 4 percent of models are non-white because all the major fashion brands started in America or Western Europe so they cater to white people who tend to be the most affluent and are the target audience for expensive merchandise. There are a lot of places in the world where white people are a minority or don&#39;t even exist and still the native people of that group have a hard time forming simple but necessary constructs to govern and dictate the general well being of the collective. Why blame yourself or the circumstances of history for the deliberate shortcomings of others. People, anywhere in the world, will respect you if you are considerate and productive. That&#39;s it, beauty doesn&#39;t matter.",1
11436,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Stupidest video title ever &quot;Trust me I&#39;m a model&quot;.,1
11437,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,model industry makes everything fake not a healthy one yes could be wealthy but same time lonely too they even don&#39;t what actually people needs to wear but good video,1
11438,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Awesome! Thank you for sharing. Thank you for being honest. This is worth sharing and much appreciated. Just shared with facebook for parents to share with their children. Continued blessings to you!,1
11439,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,judged,1
11440,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ugh. I hate these race baiting talks. Her &quot;beauty guilt&quot; and &quot;white guilt&quot; are completely over the top and unnecessary. Half of the people in the U.S. are white. You are a &quot;supply&quot; meeting a &quot;demand&quot;. There are a lot of women who want to look like you and a lot of men who would like to be in a relationship someone that looks like you. There is no reason to feel guilty about that. Of course, the part of the talk that I could appreciate is the part where she shows that the &quot;look&quot; in those pictures aren&#39;t real. That is the most important thing to understand about magazine pictures. Not the fact that someone gave her a free dress or let her out of a speeding ticket because she is pretty. Also, how is she comparing herself to a high crime city were a lot of minorities live. Of course young dark skinned males get stopped the most. They are the ones that live in the high crime areas for the most part. It&#39;s not because they are black, it because they live were the crimes are committed. High crime areas are war zones.",1
11441,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,OMG how telling and true. This was an honest expression of life THANK YOU CAMERON for showing that TRUTH is the truest form of BEAUTY!,1
11442,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
11443,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very smart woman. Great TED talk.,1
11444,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She isn&#39;t only beautiful, she is bold, intelligent, and a thinking individual. That makes her say all that she says. She has indeed won a &quot;genetic lottery&quot;. But that is she and her self. What others have done to her or what others are doing to her is a matter of great grief. They have made her feel what she is expressing here - &quot;being CONSTRUCTED&quot; for making money. We all want to be seen as we are but... When can we have freedom? Why people affect us? Can&#39;t we live a better life where we are all compassionate, free, and happy?",1
11445,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow one of the best TED talks,1
11446,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She did exactly what should be done for any social issue. She acknowledged her privilege and used it for social change. LOVE THIS TALK!!,1
11447,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"YUP. Image is everything.<br>I always get dirty looks and get called &quot;ghetto&quot;, just because I&#39;m a Black Girl.<br>And a rapper at that! :P",1
11448,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You could clearly see the fear in her way of talking. She&#39;s scared. She admitted that she had a hard time trying to find the best way to say that winning the genetic lottery isn&#39;t enough to be really happy. She was scared but she still pushes through and that my friends is courage. She probably lost some possible work offers but she still decided that it was worth it just to send her message. As I was watching this video, I had a huge urge to just hug her, not because she is pretty but because she was fighting one of her fears.",1
11449,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The white guilt is so pervasive, it&#39;s making me want to puke.",1
11450,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,e,1

11453,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was beautiful :) Thank you for your honesty. You are beautiful inside out &lt;3,1
11454,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So you are making yourself feel better about your genetic lottery by calling the police racists. Perhaps it has more to do with a culturally violent community than race.,1
11455,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t eveyrything? then why am I helpless incel virgin loser?,1
11456,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love it when attractive rich white people try to tell others what it&#39;s like to be attractive rich white people. Has this woman ever been homeless? Hungry? Persecuted and hated because of the color of her skin? No, she hasn&#39;t, and she has the audacity to &quot;empathize&quot; and &quot;share&quot; her disgustingly trivial first world problems.<br><br>Part of the problem, not the solution.",1
11457,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a thoughtful young woman.,1
11458,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,great talk,1
11459,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,your mind is BEAUTIFUL Cameron !,1
11460,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,how can this video have 2000 dislikes?,1
11461,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Respect.  ,1
11462,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Incredible speech, but because humans are fucking retarded, we have so many idiots completely missing the point and hating on her.",1
11463,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,um I love her. She&#39;s bomb. This was so honest and just bomb.,1
11464,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She may be a model, but she is also articulate and well spoken.",1
11465,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She never had a boyfriend?,1
11466,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything. Yes. Very easy to say, when you&#39;re beautiful. When you&#39;re really ugly, well, then it seems how you look is rrrreeeeeeeaaaaaallllly important!",1
11467,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wish more white people would be honest and admit that the deck is stacked in their favor. It&#39;s such a rare occurrence. I&#39;m glad I had the opportunity to witness it at least once in my lifetime.,1
11468,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A surpisingly good ted talk.....well actually they are all suprisingly good ;P,1
11469,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Excellent and thoughtful talk, Cameron.<br>Thank you!",1
11470,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,-Looks aren&#39;t important<br>-That&#39;s just what ugly people say,1
11471,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beauty gets you by. Duh. You&#39;re white beautiful and privileged.,1
11472,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It takes a lot of courage to speak out like this... She definitely is a free woman now.,1
11473,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She made some valid points but I don&#39;t feel sorry for her struggles or insecurities in any way, shape, or form. ",1
11474,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very soon you will have technology  that can give a person the skin colour he or she wants  that can be altered several times for changing circumstances,1
11475,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;You don&#39;t have to tell me now, but i&#39;ll find out later on twitter.&quot;<br><br>I love her realness.",1
11476,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So this woman is saying that she won the genetic lottery and didnt earn any part of it. She is saying that the fashion industry is bad for young girls yet I dont see her quitting her modeling career based on those principles. Nope she just stands on a stage and talks about it to satisfy her cognitive dissonance when the real proactive thing would be to retire from the industry and get a real f#$%!&amp;@ job. This is just like when Jennifer Lawrence Started that BS pr campaign about making fat shaming illegal or something ignoring the fact that seeing her attractive slim body and face promoted on tv is what does most of the damage to the selm esteem of overweight, unattractive girls.",1
11477,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This ungrateful roach should not then have herself turned into a butterfly! She has aged into a common frump with old navy taste, plain features and NO gratitude toward an industry that brings beauty to a world of mediocrity!",1
11478,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I only see God. All this reality is a false illusion. So what if you look good who cares. No one has time these days to look at ppls faces. Life is so fast paced. The body is temporary. Focus instead on spirituality. Awaken the kundalini (slowly).,1
11479,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t think she had to say about models being some of the most insecure people, because that is subjective.<br>Otherwise this was a great and honest talk",1
11480,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"how you look is also part of your identity...if you like it or not doesn&#39;t matter. of course what she says about those &quot;constructions&quot; she&#39;s right. but to say that how you look has nothing to do with your identity is just plain false. at least for every other person that can see, you yourself too(thanks mirrors). you might want to call it &quot;luck&quot; that you look the way you look(or for the reverse unfortunate) but to me that&#39;s a rather harmful way of looking at oneself. it is still a value, just like being smart or funny or overall charismatic. accept the way you are and be honest. if you look good be happy! if you don&#39;t then just don&#39;t care about it, you excel at other things that&#39;s for sure. no one is perfect, don&#39;t try to change that by saying beauty is not part of a human being, so someone who is intelligent, humble (put an infinite number of positive adjectives here) but ugly, is really perfect. he/she/it is not and that&#39;s perfectly fine, nothing wrong with that.",1
11481,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Pretty but also funny, bright and very engaging!",1
11482,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this is like a male pornstar saying penis size doesn&#39;t matter,1
11483,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Smart young woman, with a conscience. I&#39;ve seen better TED talks, but that didn&#39;t suck.",1
11484,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,To the people who think shes a hypocrite for opening this kind of dialogue may I ask... If this speech was made by a women who wasn&#39;t conventionally attractive do you think it would of made it better or would you accused her of being bitter? All beauty standards are toxic and are a utterly superficial means of assessing people. By commenting only on her appearance you completely dodge (possibly on purpose) the issue she&#39;s trying to highlight and prevent the issue from being openly discussed and a solution pursued.,1
11485,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I thought it was a great speech and she came off as intelligent, articulate, and honest. White privilege exists--beauty privilege exists. It&#39;s not her fault she&#39;s benefited from these things, and I appreciate her honesty in acknowledging it and how modeling is like winning the lottery. Knowledge that there is a problem comes first, then learning how to fix it comes second, and as the industry allows more races and also plus-sized men/women to model, it will reshape the social construct of beauty.",1
11486,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That took a lot of guts to do. An interesting insight.,1
11487,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s fucking cool and honest! ,1
11488,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is soo, soo stupid. Looks are pretty much everything if you are a woman.",1
11489,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She earned my respect. That must have taken a lot of guts.,1
11490,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Little girls should strive to be president of the United States because that&#39;s more practical than becoming a model. wow learn something new every day,1
11491,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I cant believe this has so many thumbs theres nothing wrong with the talk . ,1
11492,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I find it amazing how so many people can watch the same thing and get two completely different messages out of it. She clearly stated that what we see on the magazine covers/pages, isn&#39;t her. It&#39;s a &quot;Construction&quot; of her. How much clearer can she be. That one sentence speaks volumes. Maybe if she pointed out how short term a model&#39;s career is or how her looks will fade with time and gravity, some of you wouldn&#39;t be so negative. Society pays far to much attention on the packaging instead of the contents. You can be beautiful on the outside but when gravity and age have taken their toll, all you are left with is who you truly are. And that can only be found on the inside.That is what we need to pay attention too. And I don&#39;t know about any of you, but I would much rather be beautiful on the inside because that&#39;s the person you live with 24 hours a day.  And no amount of money would be worth atemporarysuperficial beauty anda hateful and miserable soul that you have to live with your entire life. And there are many people in this world that fit that description. They have my sympathy. Simply my humble opinion.",1
11493,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you sound ashamed of your color of your skin color shame on you,1
11494,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,great talk,1
11495,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Awesome !!!! beautiful inside and out.,1
11496,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,These comments is just urggggh!,1
11497,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think some people are missing the point of this video. There can only be a positive change in this world if people like her step up and speak out as to what they feel is right. Sure, sometimes it&#39;s superficial and you may be judged by how you look, but is it a permanent impression with others? No. You can look like Dicaprio but if you are a jerk, then no one is going to like you or care for you.",1
11498,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great insight, I wish her talk had been longer. She did an amazing job.",1
11499,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m not going to over-analyse. I enjoyed what I thought was an honest talk from an honest woman.,1
11500,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really don&#39;t understand the issue some people are having with this talk. I think she made some great points. I for one really enjoyed hearing her story.,1
11501,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"you&#39;re not insecure because you worry about what you look like everyday...<br>its your job, you&#39;re a model. You could quit, stop modeling, doing modeling shows, ads, etc...take a year off, spend some time on the couch and eat a pizza everyday.",1
11502,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I do like the fact that she acknowledges that success is less at our own strength and skills and a combination of that and mostly...luck,1
11503,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hey Cameron , please sleep with me  and willing to listen to all you have to say..message me hon.till later alligator ...",1
11504,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Actually tall isn&#39;t quite perfect but not for the reason one would think. The average male is 5&#39;8&quot; and most tall women don&#39;t give guys equal to or shorter than them a second look. Can&#39;t hold it against them, it&#39;s wired into female biology to not like shorter men so let&#39;s be above criticizing them for that ;)<br><br>At least one&#39;s weight and fashion sense can be helped, you can&#39;t help your height. Then there&#39;s income, which has many factors outside of a man&#39;s control such as education, early environment, parents&#39; wealth, etc. Even if you work hard (and get lucky, and somehow get over singles&#39; discrimination, a TED topic for another video) by the time you&#39;re settled with good money your youth will be gone and money will be that one reason why women will even give you a second look. The guy women solely like for money gets cheated on with much younger men with better abs, and those born to money, so they won&#39;t see you as a wallet are likely long since married.<br><br>&quot;Where do you work?&quot; means, &quot;Do you have money?&quot; So women are shallow too.<br><br>Tl;dr: Women are at least as shallow as men (men have lower standards in general compared to similar women, nearly all those standards are within the control of the female herself) and finding a good lady is tougher than finding intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. Given the very strict criteria of life evolving in general such as amino acids not getting fried by UV and gamma radiation on a planet perfect for life (Goldilocks zone, Earth like gravity and size, medium sized yellow star to output the correct radiation ratio to prevent too much radiation from stopping abiogenesis, gas giants to attract asteroids, tides, carbon to consume for the first microscopic life to convert to oxygen via digestion eventually leading to the first mass extinction event where the new generations consume oxygen, etc.) and five mass extinction events, as well as a catalyst to bring out that intelligence such as discovering a practical usage for fire and eventually inventing writing that&#39;s quite difficult. The odds are 10^screw it many zeroes.<br><br>Fermi&#39;s Paradox perfectly explained and solved in the process of explaining just how hard it is to find a good woman, not bad ^_^",1
11505,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,When I look at this video I feel so sorry for this woman it must be so hard to be beautiful tall slim I feel so so so sorry :  )- ,1
11506,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Honesty makes her more beautiful,1
11507,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i think it&#39;s good that she came on even though i can see how it&#39;s kind of annoying because she is privileged. i think she made a couple of good points, one being busting some myths about models and modeling and then talking about perception. the media is always trying to dupe everyone at all times, that why i dislike technology so much as it&#39;s an extension of media and not face to face and real although i use it like everyone else. i used to be pretty and then am not really anymore and it used to bother me a lot to have &quot;lost my looks&quot; but now i don&#39;t really care. if people can&#39;t like me for who I am then screw them, they aren&#39;t worth it anyway.",1

And to the frisk thing yes it&#39;s wrong to frisk anyone for no reason but I live in ny and blk and Spanish guys sell drugs differently than whites they stand on a corner yelling at any white guy they think is a lick like yo I got that then dress like a banger but get mad when cops assume they r a banger so u can&#39;t tell the world how thug u r w u dress and attitudes then want to b treated like a choir boy by the police u wanted to impress girls w ur toughness well guess what other men notice to especially the ones in blue ,1
11513,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hhh<br><br>,1
11514,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I really respect her for going up and having the courage and integrity to talk about her experiences. On the other hand it doesn&#39;t seem like she highlighted just why looks aren&#39;t everything, in fact it makes me wish I was in fact attractive.",1
11515,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Much  respect,1
11516,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its Your prespective that matters.I agree n Admire her for her talk.looking at it negatively or positively is ur choice :-) ,1
11517,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everyone fits in something shes beautiful was born with all the genes to conquer the runaway cos of the medias. Sadly true that alot of young girls cant be models and its her duty to come up and tell these beautiful girls no matter what they can be anything else if modeling doesnt work. but they do have plus size models so &quot;Model&quot; doesnt mean just skinny tall girls. either way we should appreciate her effort to come up and show us her perspectives being in a fashion industry cos alot of young girls do listen to someone they admire.,1
11518,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Message to the white people who have no idea how privileged you are If a black person had said what she said at 2.33 , 2.58 ,3.37 ....(6.54 regarding stop and search)you would have come out with the usual BS &#39;&#39; Gert that chip off your shoulder&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;Stop playing the race card&#39;&#39; type comments.Talking about playing the race card the white model is honest enough to say that when it comes to being a model white people have been playing that card for a long time.

11520,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;d rather have some morals and not be an underwear model.,1
11521,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Amazing.  So honest.,1
11522,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,oh neat. I cant wait for them to have Bill Gates do a talk on how money doesnt matter. Common now.,1
11523,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She actually looks sexier with the wrap around and the flats. I do not think Cameron would look bad in overalls and work boots.,1
11524,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hard to realize you&#39;ll never be seen more than a pretty woman. No matter how hard you try...,1
11525,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I would only give free stuff to older people out of respect but never to a person because of looks especially not when she is good looking.,1
11526,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what? she never had a boy friend? how old is she?,1
11527,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fabulously candid. Love it! ,1
11528,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Respect has been earned,1
11529,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,From genetic lottery to stop and frisk?...STFU!,1
11530,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,oh my my ! so what if she is a model ? won&#39;t u stop judgeing ? listen to her words. she speaks of truth.if u r ugly (u think so be it)<del>&quot;how can she say that when shes a model&quot; If you are preety(mind beautiful)</del>&#39;tru but doesn&#39;t she earn by modeling is it not wierd&#39;nothing can be done is something i won&#39;t say ... <br>:p if i can then i will anywhere anytime maje aware those hearts that do not know truth.. cause i m a proud human ( i might not b a gud person but yup i m not a bad one either),1
11531,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There is a good message in this video. Don&#39;t hate yourself bcoz you look a certain way. I was a model myself in my university days and I chose to become an engineer instead. After all these years, I have come to realize that modeling was just a fun phase in my life. I would model again without any qualms but what I truly am is an engineer. Modeling is just a stopgap option and not a full career in itself.<br>Glad she got that right!",1
11532,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;I&#39;m a model but I feel guilty and insecure about it.&quot; Meh, I would&#39;ve hoped she&#39;d have something more to say than that.",1
11533,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,See? Tho I havnt watched yet but theres finally some one beautiful said this out loud. ,1
11534,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"On youtube , i will say I LIKE :) for this video ...",1
11535,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Loved It. :),1
11536,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very impressive and refreshing talk. I did not expect that at all!<br>Respects from Vienna,1
11537,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She has humour ,  is great looking and has something important to say .<br>Of course people are going to hate her for that. The fact that she is a woman  makes her point even harder to get across,  because  both men and women have a hard time listening to a good looking female .  Women out of concurance ,  , men out of sexual and power  perspective . ",1
11538,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why is she out of breath after hopping a few times........? Skinny-fat personified.,1
11539,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thank you Cameron. Your courage to speak the truth about the modelling industry is truly admirable. I have seen it happen to too many young women: the more focused they are on their looks, the more insecure they are as people. That is a truth you have dared to announce. And I loved that dress up demonstration. You have a fan :)",1
11540,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful! Everyone should watch that!<br>Humans are humans. point blank period,1
11541,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"TL;DR - &quot;I am so hot, I am so rich, I am insecure, give me attention now, because being a model is not enough&quot;",1
11542,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;the free stuff that i get is the free suff that i get in real life&quot; very powerful. love that she is admitting her white privilege and beauty privilege.,1
11543,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she did great, it just would&#39;ve been nice if her talk weren&#39;t so all over the place. She is a model, not a public speaker and she could&#39;ve used a little help narrowing her message and clarifying it. :)",1
11544,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People comment here, clearly missed the point by miles, it was a great speech, of course I already knew that models are constructed, but for most girls and some dudes they think it&#39;s amazing and real, and there&#39;s a lot of people who loves nothing but themselves, its quite pathetic, no one looks beautiful 24/7, and beauty it&#39;s in the eye of the beholder, kudos to her.",1
11545,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"While I applaud her honesty, I still have to call BS on the timing- I think she decided, &#39;As they say I&#39;mnow too old for fashion, no need to suppress my morality, soI&#39;m gonna out my former industry and its practices. At least she was being honest with the &#39;I&#39;ve been cashing in&#39; part. Shame she didn&#39;t have the guts to speak up WHILE she was raking in the dollars.",1
11546,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"note to Ted.........<br>If you ever schedule a talk on &quot;looks not being everything &quot; in the future, have someone like the elephant man, give it.<br><br><br>you didn&#39;t &quot;transform&quot; anything.<br>Any guy with eyes and a pulse, still envisions you as the goddess you are.<br>You could wear a burlap sack and your beauty shines through.<br><br><br>Why be a model?<br>Because models make a million dollars a minute.<br>Most CEO&#39;s and cardio hydronic thurasic surgeons, don&#39;t.",1
11547,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this is more about how an ugly and skinny girl who looks like a 13 year old boy can get rich and famous, about only bieng white.........woooooooow so new , so fresh!!!!!!!!!!!! so helpfullllllllll",1
11548,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she is basically answering questions in regards to being a professional model, but what does that have to do with the title of the video?",1
11549,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Don&#39;t get me wrong I love this but yet till this day she is still a model,1
11550,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She seems to be overestimating her &quot;beauty&quot;, and is obsessed with being &quot;white&quot;, as if people who don&#39;t fall into the category are living a crappy life and have no future. So her point is &quot;I&#39;m so sorry u are not pretty and white&quot;? Is this how she sees the world? Totally twisted. How is this talk inspiring? Besides, Like modeling is such a Noble job, u walk and pose, get over yourself.  And minorities have smaller market, of course they have fewer models, if 80% of the targeted population are purple, I&#39;m sure there&#39;d be a lot purple models.  People in all societies look up to the riches, they want to be wealthy, not a certain color, it just happens western countries are more advanced at this point, and mostly whites are controlling the money, people&#39;s opinion of beauty are leaning towards where money is going, not because u r just so beautiful, the world is falling for u. this model just states what she observes, but she fails to scratch the surface and dig into it; she tried so hard to look like she has a problem, but comes across as snobby and superficial. The problem is not looks, the problem is people who think like her.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",1
11551,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She reminds me of Mia Thermopolis from Princess Diaries hahah,1
11552,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Loved her honesty...,1
11553,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t understand the hate here. Yeah, she&#39;s not as eloquent as most other TED speakers, but I think it&#39;s pretty darn cool of her to get up there and say these things. Tyra Banks has done the same. Rock on, Girl.",1
11554,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Brilliant talk, Cameron, Thank You",1
11555,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why are people still ignoring the point of this talk? She&#39;s literally admitting her privilege and pointing out both the biases and superficiality of the fashion industry (which can severely affect the body and beauty image of young girls everywhere) and the way people judge others based solely on physical appearance (RACE, gender, weight, hair color etc). The first part to fixing a problem is letting it be known. But if you ignore her message because you&#39;re actually just jealous she was lucky enough to be born physically attractive, you&#39;re LITERALLY contributing to the problem. This is an important message.",1
11556,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y, Powerful ,1
11557,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She claims that in 10 seconds she totally change what poeple think of her! Hardly she put on a longer skirt,She didnt pull of a body suit revealingshes actually an old man.",1
11558,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Criticizing the fashion industry has nothing to do with the claim that &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything.&quot;,1
11559,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&#39;Fearless talk &#39; ?COME ON you implie she fearless for saying her feeling when guys and women are getting blown up in the street for there religious believes. Give her another pat on the back for acting like a human-being why don&#39;t you . Some one with morales and values. You might think its out of context but if compare fearless in the REAL WORLD she not at all.<br>Am 100% think the same as skipstash70 there nothing you cant take away from this video.,1
11560,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, this is powerful. As a model, she acknowledges that looks indeed have power over the corrupt police system and that her race and gender as a white woman can give her a leeway. She also exposes how the media deconstructs her as a person and forms a separate image that is not her. She understands that she did win a lottery, not only as a pretty person but as a skinny, tall figure that is so idolized in our modern society. She is basically telling us that being a model is not a dream job, but rather a fallback, because she tells us that there is no purpose being a model (as she had told the kids to be anything else than a model), because being a model comes with a cost of being insecure all the damn time and being deconstructed to a photoshopped image. I think that we should not invalidate her point just because she is more privileged, because she APOLOGIZES for that, rather, we should look at what she is saying and stop idolizing models, stop encouraging girls to look tall and skinny, stop focusing on looks so much and see beyond a person. I think this was the point she was trying to make.",1
11561,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People are hating because she acknowledges her priveledge? &quot;omg she said she&#39;s pretty, therefore she&#39;s awful and conceited.&quot;<br>I&#39;m glad she gave that talk. I&#39;m glad that she&#39;s a model who isn&#39;t trying to make her life seem amazing, that she&#39;s trying to dispell the notion that being thin tall and white is all you need in life to be happy. If more people realize this, more people will stop trying and less value will be put on it.",1
11562,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m glad she spoke out, its her opinion on the world. We are all entitled to that, whether you agree or disagree. We are all like one body of energy that has split up into billions of species living life from different angles and experiences. Just listen and learn and move on. I&#39;m sure she knew she was going to be hated to some point, because people with simple minds would just think &quot;oh cry me a river, your still a model and still rich&quot;. I don&#39;t think shes asking for sympathy. I think shes just saying &quot;hey, how are you? I&#39;m human too, let me share &#39;me&#39; and not just a fancy staged picture&quot;. As humans we are all insecure in different levels. Not smart enough, not beautiful enough, not fast enough, not rich enough, but one thing we can all do the same and the only thing that really matters in our journey on this planet is love. So will you be a hater or will you spread love?",1
11563,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i&#39;ve worked with models now and then. <br>    What many of them want is what they don&#39;t have. This is often what many people want - what they do not have, or were not born with. Whatever it may be",1
11564,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Feed the industry for 10 years and then come wheep about it.. It&#39;s like listening to a school girl talk.,1
11565,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What I want to say that it give me a theory that looks aren&#39;t everything but most people don&#39;t go with that!,1
11566,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A model talking about how looks aren&#39;t everything, give me a fucking break.<br><br>It&#39;s like listening to a billionaire talking about that money is not everything.",1
11567,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I absolutely love your honesty. Thank you ....for your beauty gave light to my beauty which is often overlooked.,1
11568,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m still trying to figure out when being skinny was what made women attractive. I&#39;ve been trying my whole life to break 100 lbs because I&#39;ve been endlessly ridiculed for being skinny from day 1. The only people who admire thin women are other women, and there&#39;s literally no reason to. Aim to be healthy, not to be thin.",1
11569,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I honestly LOVE this talk. Because she proves not all models are stupid. You have to be incredibly smart to have the courage to be honest. And she was. And also because she showed a face of the fashion industry we never get to see.,1
11570,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"sooo she feels guilty about how she benefits from the genetic lottery, but shows how hypocritical she is by staying in the modelling industry. i learnt nothing from this talk",1
11571,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She didn&#39;t really win the genetic lottery, there was only one chance of her being born, there was no chance she would be born any other way, it was either her or some other child would have been produced in her parent&#39;s womb that wasn&#39;t her.<br><br>I&#39;d advise her to marry someone black or Asian, that way the legacy will be broken and her children won&#39;t resemble her that much and won&#39;t have to perpetuate the image of beauty she is informing the audience on, it&#39;s quite a simple solution actually.",1
11572,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There is an adage that states how to succeed in life:-<br>&#39;Be tall, be good looking, and choose wealthy parents.&#39;",1
11573,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Someone needs to get over themselves and quit feeling sorry for their good fortune. As for the small percetange of the models being of ethnic minority in the industry that&#39;s because your modeling shots are meant for the &quot;western&quot; world which is prodominately white. There is nothing racist about it, just trying to appeal to the largest demographic. I also find it hilarious that the one picture of a President she chose was Bill Clinton who probably has the least amount of respect for women as evidenced(lying &amp; adultry) by the way he treats his own wife.

11586,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Some of the comments on this are just disgusting. Sure you don&#39;t agree with this woman&#39;s life choices, what she does or how she makes a living, whatever. But the fact that she has the guts to admit that the person that we see on the magazines is not truly who she is and that she is insecure, just like any other human out there and just like all of you people who are judging her at this moment, is something that should e applauded and respected. Most of the comments are out of jealousy and ill will just because she may have few more zeros on her paycheck, but I think the thing that you guys are missing is that she is HUMAN and that she wants to be seen as one, nothing else. And that we should not judge a person by how they look or how they may appear, by the color on their skin, their gender or their occupation, because the thing that truly matters is who they are on the inside, what they feel, who they aspire to be and what they offer to the world. And it&#39;s true our society is superficial at times, and its a sad truth but I don&#39;t think we should let that overshadow who we truly are and use that negativity as motivation to prove all those naysayers wrong.

11604,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Amazing!! I&#39;ve always suspected that models were the most insecure people. That&#39;s the game--the more you feed your insecurity by trying to make your body perfect, the stronger and worse it gets. I&#39;m a guy and I used to be obsessed with having a perfect body. My girlfriend would be exasperated trying to tell me that my body was fine, I was muscular enough already and I looked great. But in the mirror I was always just a LITTLE too skinny. And I focused more and more and constantly thought about how I looked all the time, and I focused less and less on my personality, how I came off to others, my ethical choices, where I was headed in life. Bodily fixation can be a HUGE distraction and literally ruin your life. It happens to millions if not billions every day around the globe.",1

Cameron Russell stated in a simple way the manifestation of the &quot; social construction of beauty&quot; both in the everyday s life and in the Industry, and to the people that argue that she is stating the &quot;obvious&quot; well lets imagine that we are in the middle of the 18th century in the glorious slavery epoch. Oh well, a white guy its stating that he didn&#39;t get a single lash in his life cause he&#39;s white in contrast with so many people that everyday are subject of cruelties and lashes because of being non whites like him. Oh well, what a dumb talk because people are not so naive to not see that. Well, going back to the 21th century, many people with great academic preparation, professionals and normal worker people, and teens and kids and older ppl are consciously or unconsciously very, but very naive about the topic Cameron is bringing on Ted Talk. To me, Cameron talk about, discrimination, prejudice, a wink about how the magazines and fashion industries works, racism, self-consciousnesses about social injustice, women self confidence issues, and counting... in just less than ten minutes.",1

11626,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People, I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re confused. The message is clear: A free dress or a skipped parking ticket is a transient benefit, a temporary high, but with any critical thought makes you painfully aware that you&#39;re nothing more than that; that humans are viewed as nothing more than that. It quickly turns from &quot;Yay! A free meal!&quot; to &quot;Why didn&#39;t <i>that</i> girl get one?&quot; to &quot;Maybe those people were rude to me because I&#39;m not thin enough&quot; to &quot;I will never look like <i>that</i> girl no matter how much I starve, she is more valuable than me, I am a failure, those close to me probably don&#39;t even like me because they are more beautiful.&quot; This is why she began listing the apparent benefits, but then at the very end, finishes with &quot;I am insecure&quot;. The take away message is not to get into that slippery slope. If you are valued for your appearance, don&#39;t <i>become</i> your appearance. In the end, you will be chasing an ever-changing ideal that will leave never fulfilled and you will become more and more miserable with yourself. A free dress will never, <i>ever</i> be compensation for that.",1

11629,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Any time a person &quot;admits&quot; to having won the &quot;genetic lottery&quot; in regards to their physical appearance, athletic or mental abilities, etc, the real driver of the statement is deep-seated narcissism. It doesn&#39;t matter if you agree with her reasoning or not. The reality of the situation is that she is humble bragging.",1
11630,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,very important message for superficial people and young girls.,1
11631,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Life is not about the destination, but how you get there. If you&#39;re given everything early on what have you got to gain? Homeless people given a coffee and a sandwich feel happiness stronger than a rich celeb given a billion dollar house. ",1
11632,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Super fair, very true. She&#39;s as much a victim as a beneficiary. Read up, you all, on hedonic adaptation. We get used to things we experience every day. Every day, she wakes up in a physical reality that has positives and negatives.<br><br>Let me ask you this: if she were born in a body that was shorter, fatter, and had narrower eyes and a thinner smile, might she have decided to make something ELSE of herself? What might that have been? Musician? Programmer? Artist?<br><br>What didn&#39;t she do because of what she is?",1

Look around you; there&#39;s NOTHING in this world that has been invented by a female (with the possible exception of &quot;angel wings&quot; on maxi-pads.) The great geniuses who advance civilization have ALWAYS been male, and always will be. civilization. If women ruled the world, humanity never would have left the Stone Age!<br>This woman needs to shut up and be happy she &quot;won the genetic lottery&quot;, because otherwise she&#39;d be UGLY and ditzy instead of just pretty and ditzy.",1
11635,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I disagree about models being the most insecure. Even though my profession isn&#39;t modeling, I think about how I look every day. It&#39;s always a concern to me. It feels like it&#39;s never enough. I&#39;ll find a skirt that makes my butt look really good, a top that makes my boobs seem really big, or a makeup trick that makes my eyes really pop. I&#39;ll get compliments, but it&#39;s never enough. I&#39;m an insecure woman, yet music is my career.",1
11636,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Congrats for the courage to be honest!,1
11637,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So......being white is ideal, yet she just came back from a tan that was required for work.",1
11638,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think everybody is missing her point, shes saying that looks are not everything because there are tens of thousands of beautiful girls with great DNA, that will never make a cent modeling because its like winning the lottery EVEN if you are beautiful like her, so shes saying even though she made a living off it, its a poor career to aspire to",1
11639,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,WOW! Excellent talk,1

11641,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok this is very nice. I like the anti racist stuff too. But I didn&#39;t like the end where she says models are probably the most insecure people. If she started that statement with &quot;I have been inside the body of every human on the planet and have concluded that models are the most insecure&quot;, you would probably think she was a little nuts. By making her original statement, she is pretty much insinuating that. I am almost positive she has not. Plus it also insinuates that the mind of a model is the same across the board. I am almost positive it is not. But I did think this was a nice effort overall.",1
11642,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I wonder if I really enjoyed this speech because of how interesting, self-aware and intelligent the speaker is or only because she&#39;s a tall, pretty white model.",1
11643,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I admire her bravery in displaying her honesty :) i respect her so much more now xo,1
11644,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Im pretty sure theres a lot more to life than being really, really good looking. And I plan on finding out what that is.",1
11645,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what is the point of this no one cares boohooo im so privileged!!,1
11646,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,And i hope Victorias Secret didn&#39;t drop her coz of this &quot;controversial&quot; speech,1
11647,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A friend of mine went to a Zara store in Singapore andimmediately all the staff began following her around the store coz obviously they stereotyped her coz she was black.,1
11648,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good intentions but playing to your advantage is part of life. Genetics determine what gift you have and it is up to you to find that gift and use that gift to make a legacy.,1
11649,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she just cashing on the SJW crowd/,1
11650,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Poor girl. Bet she was happy until someone really messed with her head.,1
11651,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is like someone who was born rich saying money isn&#39;t everything. It&#39;s not everything, but it&#39;s a lot. And for some people, it&#39;s far more than the full sum of everything they have going for them, and to them, it does seem like everything, and for good reason.",1
11652,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"SO many haters. OMG, she&#39;s pretty and won the lottery, but she knows it and spends the money so she&#39;s evil! Idiots. She already explained that it&#39;s not like you can chose to be a model for a little while, and then all of a sudden BOOM you&#39;re a respected politician. It doesn&#39;t work like that. She became a model at a young age (while most of us were probably making minimum wage), and yeah, she&#39;s still a working one. So you wanna berate her for understanding her own white privilege? You kinda have to be in the system to destroy it. Speaking out like this, she puts herself in the best position to be a part of changes that can take place within the industry.<br><br>Just because ya&#39;ll don&#39;t know how to play chess, you gotta hate. tsk tsk.",1
11653,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lady, you didn&#39;t &quot;win a genetic lottery.&quot; You inherited a skinny body with minimal boob-and-buttage. That&#39;s why you were a model. Designers want their models to have skinny bodies so that the clothes hang down as they would on a hanger. <br><br>Betty page won a &quot;genetic lottery.&quot; She was beautiful, but was rejected from fashion modeling because her curves prevented her from being able to wear the designers&#39; clothes. ",1
11654,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she seems sweet but i don&#39;t really get the point of her doing this talk.,1
11655,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fantastic <br>,1
11656,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
11657,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m sorry, but she&#39;s full of it.<br>I feel so talked down to.",1

11659,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow. After reading some of the top comments I can&#39;t believe how wasted these TED talks are on some people. This TED talk was awesome. If you have a negative opinion after this video go watch it again. You obviously didn&#39;t understand it.,1
11660,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful talk.  Thank you ,1
11661,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,In reading most of the comments it just goes to show that people are ignorant. Many of those commenting completely missed the point she was trying to make...smh,1

11663,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"For one there more white models  because there are just more white people in the world. And I came up with a theory about the white/light skin being considered ideal of beautiful skin and that if you&#39;re some what attractive but not amazing looking the lighter your skin the better you look but if you&#39;re just a fucking goddess with the perfect nose, lips, eyes you would look amazing in any skin color. <br>",1

She doesn&#39;t have to work.Her sister is not nearly as attractive, never married,and still lives in a poor village. Her life could not be more different than my sister-in-law. One of the things that I find interesting about &quot;beautiful&quot; people is that they, seemingly, have a higher degree of confidence. Theyrarely get rejectedand can smile there way out of most situations. Life isn&#39;t fair.",1
11666,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She complaining that she gets out of tickets and gets free stuff? Oh the horror this poor women has to go thorugh. Jesus fucking Christ even being good looking is now a &quot;social justice &quot; cause.,1
11667,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I call bull crap, what studies did she cite? I&#39;ve seen multiple viable studies that show attractiveness is a plus in nearly every aspect of life. I&#39;ve witnessed it too but that means nothing...the studies show you are more likely to get a job, get more attention from an instructor in school, get more chances for more variation of partners, etc. That&#39;s just a fact and a very important one to understand...I don&#39;t think this woman presented that side at all.",1
11668,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow she is beautiful, smart, humble... A real Woman!",1
11669,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"somebody should introduce her to ISLAM religion , that&#39;s exactly the point behind wearing our Hijab/Veil !<br>feeling of security and self respect, as people should be treating our minds not bodies !",1

11674,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is a little humblebraggy. She&#39;s hot. I think everyone gets that being superhot and being photographed and paid a lot is not the same as being a rocket scientist, but everyone would love to be around a supermodel--rocket scientists, not so much. We crave beauty. That beauty is not synonymous with depth is so obvious as to be idiotic. I prefer someone like Kate Moss who completely owns the space she &quot;won&quot; in, then harvested to her advantage in a massive way.",1
11675,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I thought this was really good not as in depth as other ted talks there was one study talked about and I would have liked it to be longer.  I would have really liked if there was an experiment to back up as the others have done, but at the end im glad she came out and was honest about her feelings for image.",1
11676,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Should be re-titled &quot;Being White shouldn&#39;t be everything&quot; :-P,1
11677,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think you&#39;re beautiful! :),1
11678,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I like how she phrases this. Being pretty doesn&#39;t make you happy (in fact it can make you even more insecure), and looks are ultimately superficial despite their power. Even the prettiest people are not made happy by their looks; you need to find your peace somewhere else.",1
11679,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,<b>SHHHHH everyone quiet. The model is saying something about being born beautiful traveling the world and how much money shes made.</b> Cue theviolins. ,1
11680,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To everyone hating on this talk, consider this- she probably just eight-balled herself by giving this talk, i.e. she likely pissed off a lot of potential employers for her. This took guts, both in terms of coming to grips with the only personal reality she&#39;s ever known, and in terms of calling it how it is in the face of impending professional backlash. Did she cure cancer? No. But you have to appreciate her candidness and honesty in spite of an industry largely shrouded in a mum&#39;s-the-word approach to results transparency.",1
11681,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Works both ways, I&#39;m a big black man and although I&#39;ve been racially profiled a lot by the police - I still enjoy the fact that I can go anywhere at night without worry of being attacked. I have a friend who has been robbed several times simply because he&#39;s a skinny white guy.",1
11682,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, looks aren&#39;t everything, but I wonder what her life is like, being a model, seeing her face on magazines and on TV, showcasing the latest fashion and stuff. The same way an artist or anyone else, when viewing their work, feels, I bet she feels really confident or amazed by her own beauty when she sees herself... I wish I could live as her for a while, see what it&#39;s like. I know the life of a model isn&#39;t all fun and ease and luxury, but it still definitely has its perks. I bet she travels and stuff. IDK. While she&#39;s telling other kids that they could be her boss, or something cool, she is a model because she got lucky... I wonder if she would trade shoes with one of those kids looking up to her. Probably not.",1
11683,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A lot of people say all this &quot;oh so you&#39;re pretty and you get things for it boo-hoo&quot; and they just don&#39;t get she&#39;s not trying to victimize herself over that, just bring awareness.",1
11684,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lol who cares? She&#39;s still hot and other&#39;s are not, boo-hoo.",1

11688,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s right. People are insecure but the most insecure people are usually the pretty ones. Because they always have to think about how they look everyday because people care about how they look as they are in the eye of public. Easy examples are celebrities. ,1

11690,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oh and what a load of crap saying that models are the most insecure women out there. I really do believe you are so insecure you are able to strut down a catwalk half naked and regarded as a &quot;supermodel&quot; and pose for Vogue, obviously because you believe you are unattractive and insecure! Oh poor you and yet she makes thousands from images she sells. This is an insult to those who are heavier, don&#39;t want to pose for a picture and couldn&#39;t dream of wearing a tight short skirt. Every point she makes here is dumb and reflective of someone who doesn&#39;t understand what kind of business she is in.",1
11691,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think its hypocritical for her to assume that the model industry may be racist and leave models with a gap in their resume yet she has spent years making money out of this industry. If she was smart she obviously would know that modelling is a BUSINESS and like all business it&#39;s shaped by consumer demands. If &quot;white&quot; sells it&#39;s down to the &quot;buyers&quot; &quot;us&quot; who shapes the big brands to demand the image that sells. Beauty is the fundamental selling point. It&#39;s not the industry who&#39;s racist it&#39;s us. A lot more chinese models are popping up due to larger consumer demands in China. As a model you are a self employed as business woman and only the smart survive a highly competitive industry. Mirander Kerr, Karlie Kloss, Doutzen Kroes, Kate Moss and Wilhemina Cooper prove that if you are smart enough you can gain huge profit. ",1
11692,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She did a wonderful speech!!! ,1

11701,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m so thankful she talks about the fact those pictures are not really of her. She is the raw material from which they construct an evil and impossibly beautiful image that hurts men to just look at. Those pictures they want us to stare at are not real. They have an evil purpose.,1
11702,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful talk about beauty.,1
11703,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How beautiful; I found this very refreshing and beautifully honest. I got goosebumps from this talk. Spot on.,1

11705,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"How idiotic. This woman claims looks aren&#39;t everything, yet she made her whole living and millions of dollarsbased on howshe looks. She does has some valid and true points though. The sad of it is, she isn&#39;t even that pretty, but she hasthat certain look that snooty gay model scouts look for in girls. Thus, they set their own industry standards and aesthetic opinions and thentry to sell to the rest of us what is attractive. The fashion industry disgusts me.",1
11706,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She was so focused on how lucky she is to be beautiful that she failed to drive the point home.,1
11707,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;looks arent everything but im white and pretty, and it pays off. you&#39;re black and ugly, so you struggle. Welp.&quot;",1

11710,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Bullshit. Only attractive people say that &quot;looks don&#39;t matter&quot;. They are trying to be deceivingly humble while laughing at everyone else behind their back. I&#39;ve experienced this first hand. Try talking to any ugly person who&#39;s been rejected explicitly or implicitly and/or treated worse by society because of their appearance. Looks aren&#39;t everything, but they matter a lot. Why not focus our attention on something else like designer babies so we can make everyone look attractive?",1
11711,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In the wonderful movie Almost Famous, a character said, &quot;Beautiful  people have no spine.&quot;  This young woman is an exception. ",1
11712,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,awesome speech coming from a model :),1
11713,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this is such an incredible speech, encouraging people to be more than what they look like. This just goes to show how intelligent Cameron is and deserves so much respect for being so honest about her experience with modelling. ",1
11714,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"not a very well thought out talk, but the intentions were there, at least.",1
11715,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I accept her just the way she is.,1
11716,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In my opinion what she says is completely invalid. She is beautiful, and thus never had to go through the difficulties of being ugly. To stand in front of hundreds of average people, and tell them how beauty can be hard, is like bill gates standing in front of normal people and start telling them about how it&#39;s difficult making 4 million dollars every time he goes to sleep.<br><br>I understand there are some hardships. But these hardships, are minor to people who can&#39;t even look at themselves in the mirror.<br><br>insecure? Really? When men want you and women want to be you? that&#39;s it? That&#39;s actually disgusting. Its like the spoiled kid who explains how its unfair he only got the standard porsche.<br>Imagine waking up one day, hideous, where you&#39;ll most likely end up alone because no one is attracted to you, and no one treats you fairly because you look funny. Where the only time people pay attention to you is to remind you how ugly you are. That&#39;s what I understand to be hardships. Not some &quot;I&#39;m insecure because I&#39;m too pretty and get lots of free stuff&quot;",1
11717,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is very true. We tell children that looks don&#39;t matter so that they can build their personalities. But by the time we&#39;re adults we all know that it matters.,1
11718,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What a refreshing and interesting talk, I wish it would have lasted longer.",1
11719,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A well spoken talk about image as a construction. I would like to hear more on the darker side of the modelling career that she briefly mentions at the end; I don&#39;t buy what she said about models being insecure so perhaps she should have elaborated on that.,1
11720,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"it&#39;s so heart-warming that someone like Cameron who benefitted from the modelling industry reflects upon her successes and compares her privileged life to the life of an ordinary person. To everyone other person who hasn&#39;t won the genetic lottery, press on! Focus on your other successes and skills, and you wouldn&#39;t get the judgment you&#39;ll receive from being a model! :)",1

However celebrities and models especially, are always judged on their appearance which sucks ... for example right now EVERYBODY is obsessed with the &quot;with and without make-up&quot; pictures of celebrities, and also &quot;before and after plastic surgery&quot; photos.",1
11726,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Relying upon one&#39;s accomplishments rather than one&#39;s physical attributes is still a good message regardless of the difficulty in getting it across.I think such a message-substance is more important over image....short and long term-needs to become as commonplace a notion as the idea that &#39;first impressions&#39; are important.<br><br>There are many industries that exist solely because of image.And it&#39;s so sad how so many people are mislead by advertisers salespeople and media.I believe this is a significant problem;and it is nothing new...but I applaud the effort she made to address it.,1

11729,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m not sure if I got anything out of this vid. A beautiful model says she lucky because of a genetic lottery and also wants to show she does not have the personality of the images she has to portray. In fact it seems like she would love to be a politician. Maybe she has something to help those in need. However, she finishes the talk saying she is insecure and always wondering about her looks. In which case she needs to get out of the business and pursue a different career, she has the choice and as I don&#39;t know her personally, I will superficially judge her on how she looks and so would 99% of the population if they were truthful, the other 1% would be lying.",1
11730,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Cameron Russell you are amazing !,1
11731,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I stoped watching the video the minute she changed her clothes,1
11732,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Whoever thought that looks are everything anyway? Unless you&#39;re a model ,in which case they count for an awful lot.",1
11733,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"to all those that think this women has &quot;no right to complain bc shes so pretty&quot; or whatever, a great man once said this:<br>&quot;Nobody&#39;s got it made&quot; <br>- Bruce Springstein",1
11734,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah, I think she was complaining-in an empathetic way.... she was complaining about the lot of others who are less privileged than she is. She wasn&#39;t complaining about her life. Why attack somebody who is putting themselves in others&#39; shoes? Do you know how many white people would either ignore the fact that minorities are targeted by the police, or say they deserve the targeting? Geesh, she is really puts herself out there, and just because she can&#39;t entirely understand what those less fortunate go through, she TRIES to walk in the shoes of others.",1
11735,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I meant to say, the last thing you made clear was etc...",1
11736,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One of the points she made was how there was a lot of racism in the world and she didn&#39;t support it. In fact, she did the opposite. But, the first thing you made clear in you comment was that you were implying that white people were complainers and spoiled. I might be black or white or purple you don&#39;t know that. But I am a alot wiser and smarter that you and I am 13. ",1
11737,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Excuse me? What is that supposed to mean? &quot;You white people&quot;.<br>Now, you have completely missed the point of the entire thing. Yes, you have experienced a very hard life with many people being racist and disrespectful towards you but what you said just then is making you the person you hate most. Did you even listen to any of what she was saying? Read the title of the video for goodness sakes. Getting angry is not going to do anything but you have to be careful of what you say.",1
11738,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There are many women like Cameron, most couldn&#39;t care less what other people think of them off camera as they are themselves but when the make up and little dress goes on they become different people, this is why Cameron changed clothes, to depict her as herself, not the model.<br>That&#39;s great so when she sees a mechanic to fix her car she puts on the act, the smile and the little voice with charm to have her car fixed, she knows exactly who to walk up to later to pick up her car as she remembers his face but I can guarantee that if she met that same mechanic in a night club and asked him what he did for a living she wouldn&#39;t give him one more second of her time just in case people recognise her but here she wants us to think differently of her just because she changed clothes.<br>If being a model was a horse men/women jump on and don&#39;t want to get off but want us to think they are just like one of us, sorry but I don&#39;t think so, and the same goes for TV personalities and movie stars.",1
11739,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What did she say?,1
11740,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,of course another gorgeous model saying looks aren&#39;t everything,1
11741,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Face is pretty but her body isn&#39;t as great as she thinks.<br>Honestly, a real woman looks so much cuter. That won&#39;t stop the liberals and feminists from screaming down my throat, though.",1
11742,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Found it hard to finish watching this ted talk, lack of inspiration.",1
11743,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I can understand why she did this. When you get wrongfully judged by people, you feel uncomfortable and want to explain the whole story.<br><br>I&#39;m not good looking, but I am thin. And people always judge me wrongfully, such as I am mega healthy and I can eat all the McDonald&#39;s and chocolates I want.<br><br>No, being thin does not guarantee healthy. Yes being thin may significantly reduce the health issues that overweight / obese people suffer, but don&#39;t forget there are plenty of different health problems that exist today.<br><br>I admit, I thought she would have said more personal stuff, but I admire about the whole message. As the old saying: never judge a book by its cover.",1
11744,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ohh I&#39;m so attractive.. What a tragedy.. !,1
11745,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i think she is right, everyone has their own problems in every field of job, even she feel uncomportable but with me, her job and what she was doing was so awesome! in spite of the pact that every and each job has its downsides, it always has a meaningfull purpose, so her job is, and thus i really want to say that if it is our fate, why don&#39;t we face and consider it with a other aspect that could help it to remain in sociaty for a long time ? . besides that, i &#39;m a student in university, my field of study is computer science, and everyone thinks that my job is so great, but do they know that in order to become a real programmer we have to experience a very very hard time to practise ourselves about skills or knowledge, and i really believe that a master in computer science is the one who could be worth with what they have done. With me, i know that my furture would be a hard time to continue , sometime i used to think that may i choose a wrong field? Should i start again? however, i have to be responsive with what i have done, i chose it, and i must spend more time on it so as to master at it, that is what i am thinking now, time is going by, everything would be changed even your mind, just keep in mind that everything would have a way to go forward..... ",1
11746,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Congratulations for being Courteous, Considerate, Courageous, Compassionate, Class/Cast Conscientiousness. ",1
11747,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s beautiful, and people should appreciate her for that. If you were not born &quot;attractive&quot; per se, there are numerous other talents and abilities that you have which should be exploited to their potential. The world is not equal; it&#39;s your responsibility to take what you have and make something productive and valuable from that.",1
11748,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,beautiful :),1
11749,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I doesn&#39;t matter what she wears. Her hotness would show through even if she wore all her clothes at the same time like Joey did on Friends.,1
11750,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Tell that to the girls I know,1
11751,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I hope she doesn&#39;t read most of these comments. Their so negative and horrible. This woman strikes me as intelligent, self-aware and very empathetic. She is beautiful, and even if most of that beauty is natural some of it is maintenance and long hours of hard work. She is aware of the world around her and seeks to use her position as a &#39;beautiful&#39; woman to inspire other people to stop judging themselves by aesthetics, and to start looking past their appearances. Listening to her, I know that her honesty and position as a model in the industry will reach young women and perhaps influence them to start accepting their bodies as natural and beautiful and to stop judging themselves based upon a constructed image.",1
11752,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really enjoyed this talk. It was refreshing to know someone in her position is insightful about these issues. It is a miracle in this day and age tbh,1
11753,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,aaaannnnnd she will continue modeling and being constructed and cashing in on the rewards of the genetic lottery.... butttt looks aren&#39;t everything. Ride that gravy train as long as you can... nothing wrong with that.,1
11754,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Amazing talk!,1
11755,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So... she&#39;s like: I&#39;m pretty and you&#39;re not. This is a reminder. Bye bye!<br>:P,1
11756,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the first minute made me re avaluate , thx Cameron",1
11757,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Gender oppression. Lost me there.,1
11758,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I heard naomi?! ,1
11759,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow, that was pointless.",1
11760,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Guys all she&#39;s saying is that we shouldn&#39;t underestimate the power of images influencing human feelings and behaviour. She&#39;s honest about the injustice of society based on how good looking you are!,1
11761,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y, m a tween and is this why the boys in my school let me hang out with them?????? Is this true because I thought they were my friends!!!!????,1
11762,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When your livelihood depends on your aesthetic, you will be insecure about your appearance by default.<br><br>Being born with privilege is not fair, but I believe if you work hard at something and do things the right way, you will be rewarded for your efforts.<br><br>Also, there is too much victimization going on this country, especially when people are just addressing the cause. It&#39;s much better to come up with an alternative approach/solution and work around obstacles that will always be there. ",1
11763,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is great talker and a hot mada /: wow ,1
11764,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I watched the whole thing but i have no idea what she said,1
11765,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The big thing not said (but can be detected by anyone with a logical, intelligent brain, which are very few) is that physically &quot;beautiful&quot; people are the most hated.  Not to brag, but people assume things and hate me just because of the way I look (some might call me a pretty boy).  I&#39;d say that &quot;beautiful&quot; people are easily accepted by open-minded people and perhaps those easily enamored by your beauty, but there are very few open-minded people and anyone who is not physically attracted to you will hate your guts just for how you look. ",1
11766,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Lots of people being hard on her because she&#39;s being honest about the way things are...,1
11767,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;very little we can do to transform our bodies&quot;??? I would like to oppose that opinion...there is ALOT we can EASILY do to transform our bodies.,1
11768,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I didn&#39;t learn anything from this TED. I&#39;d have learned there&#39;s white hot privilege but i&#39;ve known it since near birth.,1
11769,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To turrican  fourteen.i think the popo should stop,and harass you for a while,then maybe you would have a little bit of empathy sir.",1
11770,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,To James bondage.she is absolutely very attractive.,1
11771,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow that was so deep and I can&#39;t believe it came from her or (as she said), a tall skinny pretty white girl. When I first clicked on the video, I honestly didn&#39;t think she was going to say all those things. I think it is so powerful to admit that you have been the beneficiary of centuries of racial, ethnic, and gender bias. I think it is amazing for her to admit and acknowledge that especially when she is a model too. And let&#39;s be real, we all probably have that stereotype about her, that girls like her don&#39;t have anything in their brains, that they are just stupid, vapid girls who care about nothing but superficiality. But it is a great eye opener to realize that in her case, it is the opposite. She is super thoughtful and raises some great points about how humans view certain things. I think that all the things she pointed are so true. I think there are so many wrong things in our society that makes us all value superficiality. All people care about is money, which is why producing the most beautiful, unrealistic picture of a skinny white girl (which is society&#39;s idea of beauty) is the goal. I mean, really, why are women so objectified? Certainly, because of our history. Girls are so insecure about their bodies because society leads us to believe that women should be objectified and their bodies should be a certain way. This is why I think Cameron says that models are the most insecure because they must ascribe to this unrealistic ideal that we are all buying into. Also, why does our society value superficiality so much as opposed to honesty and realness and love and all the other things we should value and that we maybe valued in the past? Why does Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton get so much money for literally being a waste of human space? And the thing is, it is not Kim Kardashian&#39;s fault that people constantly reward her for contributing nothing to society, it is all our faults for idealizing her. Why do people watch all her shows on TV? If we all stopped watching them, she wouldn&#39;t even be famous or earn money. Why are hard working teachers and nurses not the ones who get attention? They contribute so much to society, yet they get rewarded so little. Maybe it is just that there is something inherently wrong with humans. Maybe we are just programmed to value the wrong things, to reward the underserving. Maybe it is something about life, that it is inherently unfair. But maybe also, in the end, the deserving are rewarded. Those who are remembered are those who fought the hardest and were oppressed the most such as Martin Luther King, Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela. Anyway, that was my super philosophical rant for the day.",1
11772,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She did well,1
11773,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How do people have negative things to say about this? I think this was amazing.,1
11774,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,video would take less time if it wasn&#39;t for the uncomfortable laughter. and the uhms.,1
11775,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I Think this video is good at bringing awareness of this issue but it really is &quot;easier to be thin.&quot; I was an obese child and it made social situations very difficult for me. other kids automatically assumed i was a slob and stupid and didn&#39;t want to be my friend because i was fat. Boys didn&#39;t like me because I was fat and it lead me to grow up thinking I was worth less because of my weight. I think that it stunted me socially to be fat. I became anorexic at age 13 when I weighted 180lbs. I struggled for years with my body image and various eating disorders. I was able to get over my eating disorders in college and I now have a bachelors of science in Nutrition and I am a first year medical student working on my M.D. in Texas and weight 180lbs as a 5&#39;11 22 year old. So yes, I do think it is easier to be thin.",1
11776,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she seems out of breath and really uncomfortable. man this is boring i&#39;m out of here,1
11777,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you so much for this wonderful speech!,1
11778,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m a white guy and I like black/asian women just as much as white women, surely I&#39;m not the only one?<br>Why is she saying you have to be white to be considered attractive wtf is this XD",1
11779,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hi Cameron; Congratulations on your presentation; you certainly have a gift; it is NOT easy to stand in front of public and brief on &quot;Who I am&quot; .. excellent !!!<br><br>I am sure it will inspire many persons to remain honest with what we really are, to overcome our own weaknesses to reach our maximum potential.<br><br>You may want to read about Pndar&#39;s poems: &quot;Be what you know you are&quot;<br>&quot;It is an inescapable condition to know who we are in order to arrive at knowledge of what we are (Pindaro).&quot;<br><a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pindar"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pindar</a>",1
11780,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So youtube why was this recommended to me? Trying to say something huh?,1
11781,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this is amazing she is beautiful inside and out,1
11782,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This sucked,1
11783,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"isn&#39;t her talk totally contradicting?<br>Looks aren&#39;t everything. from this talk, they are almost everything.",1
11784,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great her vulnerability shine through ... clearly spoke from the heart,1
11785,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why do you think the majority of 16-18 y/o&#39;ds get pulled by police?? because they&#39;re doing most of the crimes lol,1
11786,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A beautiful speech that reveals much more than skin.,1
11787,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s hot,1
11788,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Believe me, I&#39;m a model.&quot; Whoever said models were good looking. Being a model is like being a body builder to men. People will stare at you, a certain insecure crowd are into it; no one thinks it&#39;s hot.",1
11789,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This TED talk was awful, she spent half the time building herself up calling herself the perfect genetic model. Though the topic is a serious one, the delivery was in my opinion community college speech class level.",1
11790,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People have different problems. Just because you think yours are harder doesn&#39;t mean they are. If everybody grew up exactly as she did, they would see how hard her problems are. That also applies to everyone else. Put yourself in their shoes. She gave an amazing talk. I respect her. ",1
11791,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything.&quot; HAH I&#39;m sorry, but yes they are. (And this is coming fromagirlwho hates everything about herself.)",1
11792,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s tall and pretty, so what&#39;s the problem?",1
11793,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,trite garbage. someone gave her a platform to just go on some bs apologist rant while not even beginning to propose solutions or personal amendments to the problems she&#39;s bringing up. this is basically a vanity hand washing session.,1
11794,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thank you for your honesty. You are right...privilege is espoused by a construct, which history at least the one we all get to devour,is one written by White Men (historical &amp; contemporaneously) . Its only when the truth of those &#39;caricatures&#39; which we all think are real speak like you choose courageously to do. It is then that we realise our complicity and howfalliblethis&quot;real beauty&quot; is! In understanding these machinations do we release our children - daughters and sons from its absurdgraspso they cantruly define their reality, their sense of worth and be free of the banal, cruel impacts. Beauty...we all have that.",1
11795,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Damn, she&#39;s hot.",1
11796,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is saying that &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; means... You don&#39;t need to lose weight or gaining lots of makeup to be a model.Where you are as the model is the fiction, but what you are as real is a true color. People outer in world ALWAYS judging based on looks or race even gender and sexuality. You can&#39;t make the assumption on a person because you haven&#39;t got a chance to get to know them but instead you&#39;re labeledmodels as Attention or desperate. I think that you&#39;re very closed minded and judgemental. It&#39;s the sad event that people had to judge to oppression on victims. Stereotype is stereotype.",1
11797,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a wonderful thing to do,1
11798,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That whole changing clothes thing didn&#39;t &quot;totally change&quot; the way she looked to me.,1
11799,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s not even that pretty.,1
11800,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It saddens me to see all the female haters on this video. This girl was INCREDIBLY NERVOUS to do this. Here she is, valued only for her looks, and she&#39;s trying to basically say that that is wrong, and all anybody can do is criticize her for being &quot;lucky&quot;. She&#39;s saying the exact same thing as everyone else! That it is wrong to be valued only for your appearance.",1
11801,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this is pure, positive energy, thanks a lot!!!",1
11802,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She only tells her experiences and tries to tell not only the looks of the models but the looks of all people including men are not everything; that does not mean models are brainless. and she is right in the end. .,1
11803,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,look isnt everything but could be your starting point...good video...for models,1
11804,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she will be fine. ,1
11805,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ehhhh shut up <b>in Bugs Bunny voice</b>,1

11807,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think as men we expected to react t to what is considered beautiful. When it comes down to honesty I am comfortable with my manhood and I found Cameron Russell more attractive after she changed. And I&#39;m not ashamed to admit it.,1
11808,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,india is salvation :p,1
11809,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Such honesty and transparency. It was truly brave of her. I wish someone from the industry had been this brave to come forward when I was growing up. It might have changed my perception of things. I hope the younger people who viewed it can understand what she was trying to do. It was a great thing. ,1
11810,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is a weak presentation its all over the place, and there&#39;s absolutely nothing interesting or new about it, nothing we dont already know. The only interesting thing was after stating all the great things in her life she tells us that she&#39;s still self conscious about herself. If she would have digged deeper into that instead of stating random little facts that had nothing to do with anything, this presentation might have been a little interesting.",1
11811,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She said nothing. More or less a watered-down, insignificant biography.",1
11812,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A Model saying &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; is like Donald Trump telling people in a 3rd world country &quot;Money isn&#39;t everything&quot;  ,1
11813,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I swear why the heckling is she insecure?? I&#39;m the one that&#39;s fat and ugly who can&#39;t eat junk and works her butt off everyday and still looks bad. She doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be insecure and will never know how bad it really is to be judged just because you&#39;re not as good looking as the other girls in your surroundings. Wow. Just wow.,1
11814,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great girl !!!!,1
11815,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,We&#39;re so programmed to like white skin that she had to get a fake tan for her modeling job...,1
11816,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Empathy and understanding.... something the comment section is lacking,1
11817,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She had so much to say! Wish she had more time, it seems like she touched on some very important things but never got to expand. Hope she can do a bigger piece!",1
11818,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"......uh, better topics please? Anything better to complain about? How about how it sucked to jam your toe in the door this morning?",1
11819,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Are you serious? She&#39;s not complaining...she&#39;s simply stating something that is TRUE. She feels bad that society has this mindset. She feels bad that the only thing she does it wave her arms and get dressed up. Maybe try to see it from both perspectives and not just your own. She&#39;s &quot;lucky.&quot; She knows it too. So stop blaming her for trying to sympathize with society. Talk about insecurities...she can&#39;t win with yall. ,1
11820,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This comment section makes me so angry.,1
11821,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"but models aren&#39;t always attractive... the least attractive people are beauty therapists though, I&#39;ve met quite a few who were obsessed with cosmetics, plastic surgery etc, constantly bragging about how hot they were... The really beautiful people aren&#39;t obsessed with this behaviour, they might use make up of some sort or another, but they don&#39;t consider their looks to be a competition because their aesthetics were never at jeopardy anyway. The more you bring attention to yourself, in the case of these beauty therapists, the more you are prone to judgement, which puts you in an infinite loop of applying more and more cosmetics. It&#39;s like comfort food for some people.",1
11822,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I appreciate her thoughtfulness and honesty but talks like this just drive me crazy. You wanna sit there and show how sad it is that girls lose all love for their appearance by the time they are 17 but you&#39;re showing photos of girls that are STILL prettier than I&#39;ve ever been or ever will be. You talk about how we are fine the way we are but are still showing photos of people like that. I can&#39;t believe that statement when you express it in a way that is not applicable to me, if that makes sense.<br><br>Looks don&#39;t matter? They always have to me. They mattered when people spent their time around me reminding me of how bad my looks are. They mattered when I wondered if I was so ugly that I&#39;d never be loved. They matter when I walk out of the house to work, wondering if people are going to think less of me or respect me less because I&#39;m not pretty or thin. Ignoring how beauty matters is cruel to me, to everyone. Looks do matter. They matter in how race decides how we are treated, when our clothes decide, when our face decides, when our gender decides. And that fucking sucks.",1
11823,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,One of the best TED&#39;s I&#39;ve seen i LOVE brutal honesty! ,1
11824,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You would think that more people would have a little bit more understanding of the fact that the modelling industry is toxic to it&#39;s employees from her TED talk, but I guess there are more superficial minds than observational ones.",1
11825,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i think she&#39;s brave for standing in a room full of strangers and telling them she&#39;s insecure... she&#39;s trying to get young girls a message that modeling isn&#39;t as glamorous as they think and they should aspire for a higher purpose in life, i don&#39;t understand some of the negative comments because it clearly looks like she&#39;s feeling guilty of being treated better just because of how she looks while others don&#39;t get the same treatment, in my eyes that&#39;s a woman who has a very pure heart because she&#39;s thinking about others and not just herself which breaks the model&#39;s stereotype for me, i really admire her because she&#39;s giving me the hope that there&#39;s still goodness in this world and there are people who are against the injustice in this world... i can&#39;t count the number of times i got laughed at or treated badly because of how i look, but i never envied the pretty girls because i know that NO ONE has it all they might for example have a terrible disease yet i&#39;m perfectly healthy, or they might be not as smart or they might come from a broken home and never experienced the love of a family while i&#39;m surrounded by loved once, so i don&#39;t hate them because i know they lack something just like i do...",1

11827,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow,1
11828,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeh right. My heart fucking bleeds for her.,1
11829,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This talk isnt about the ugly side of paradise...its about a tall beautiful white woman, saying all the things that those who wish they could be her say, without trying to sound like a complete b. It is interesting her pictures show her the happiest in what looks like to be an African country, maybe because she doesnt feel as objectified. She can be herself, for once. Dispite what some may feel not all beautiful women want to be objects, many just want to be people. Wether you are put on a pedastal or crushed under a heel, the feelings of isolation and inadequacy are the same.",1
11830,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything, but still important. I&#39;m sure she has gotten much out of her looks both consciously and unconsciously.<br><br>It sounds like she is just a bit tired of being a model, using her looks as a way to earn money.",1
11831,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So inspiring, she spoke with honesty and admitted perceptions",1
11832,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why is it that we will dismiss what a beautiful woman says based on her looks, but we will dismiss what an ugly man says based on his looks. Good looks can prevent a woman from being taken seriously in the corporate or political world, but can only help a man be taken more seriously.",1
11833,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Mucho bullshit in less than 10min,1
11834,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I thought the message was very clear and true. People are impacted by what they look like daily. Those values are indeed superficial and I think that when people open up about it and say they actually don&#39;t like being treated differently because of their appearance, it gives others perspective on how things could or should be. Doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t dress up.<br><br>A beautiful person could easily become insecure about their inner values and its importance, being favored for their looks, likewise an ugly person could be very insecure about their appearance and how it affects the people around them, feeling restricted. We all know very well that looks do not express potential, it just isn&#39;t who we are, the shell around the egg. That&#39;s what I find so charming about Cameron, she admits knowing even with her good looks and exploiting them. Superficiality should be recognized for what it is. It&#39;s people that play with it&#39;s meaning that change the perceived reality around us. It&#39;s an abnormality just like our existence. It is what it is.<br><br>Just seeing how aware everyone is about how superficiality governs our lives and harms our mental health shows me that we, as a species, are already on the road to improvement. We just need to open up more.",1

11839,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I get what she trying to point out, like don&#39;t sought happiness from looks and how there is inequality in judgement of looks, although her wordings and how she take it just a bit scattered. I can see the impression changes when she change clothes but I get more of &#39;what?&#39; instead understand it right when she do it. Half through the video I guess.. umm yeah? on the comparison of her looks in and out stage. Maybe just me though.",1
11840,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;ll disagree with what she&#39;s saying here. I&#39;m a white guy, 6&#39;3, and I&#39;m 100% happy with the way I look (but this is only after I grew a beard and longer hair). However, I have very bad social anxiety and can&#39;t connect to people well. I definitely think looks can help, but they&#39;re not everything.",1

11851,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t understand how she &amp; other women similar to her can feel insecure I mean look at her/her job &amp; the lifestyle? I mean really?? Unless you are super ugly &amp; degraded there is no comparison to how each are treated. I&#39;m not ugly but I feel for people who are because the beautiful will always be favored over the ugly. Now if a person over eats &amp; under exercises then I think that&#39;s their own fault unless it&#39;s a medical condition then I feel for them.,1

11853,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love this Ted talk for many reasons. She is public ally acknowledging her privilege as an attractive, successful, white model and using that privilege to speak out on a corrupt society about images both beauty and racial related.

Yes so your not good looking or skinny or perfect. but if you were...would it actually make a difference? If you think deep and hard about it, the answer is no.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t matter how glossy your hair is or how wide your biceps are, you still wont be happy with it. The only way to become happy is to accept yourself for who you are. inside and out.",1
11856,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,yea she won the genetic lottery as she said but i feel literally zero empathy on her complaining about having to think about what she looks like thats just ridicilous i mean she fcking chose the model job did she not? easy job lots of money i dont think the price is nearly enough to have her complaining,1
11857,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t understand why people are giving her a hard time for being open and honest about her own personal experience in the modeling industry. If you&#39;re not in her position, you don&#39;t have the right to judge her for struggles. We all have our ownindividual issues andher feelings of insecurity and being judged based on her looks are valid andaren&#39;t something to be bashed because of how &quot;privileged&quot; she may be in the &quot;genetic lottery.&quot;",1

11862,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;I won a genetic lottery&quot; yes from her point of view, she should have asked her parent, her great great grandparents how they pick their mate. You have no power to pick your parents, but you have power to pick mates to create the next generation of you&#39;s",1
11863,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"WOW, I appreciate her bravery of making fun of herself. She realizes that she&#39;s lucky and most aren&#39;t I also appreciate that as well... that being said if she&#39;s really that humble then the man that she chooses to spend her life with will be very lucky. :-)",1

Believe me, I&#39;m a model.&quot;<br>She says these negative characteristics about looking beautiful. Which I can see are true. But at the end of the day if people had the choice, they would rather look on a scale like of 8 - 10 than to look like a 5 - 7.<br><br>In conclusion, this is definitely one of the less great and mind opening ted talks.",1

11873,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What was the point of this video?,1

I always try to avoid judging people on their looks and &#39;beauty&#39;, but I must admit that I&#39;d enjoy waking up on a morning to have a face that suits bed hair and that looks naturally elegant without having to style my hair and do my makeup....",1
11893,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Superb TED talk, well done to Cameron I hope you do an extended presentation as I am very interested in your point of view. Very open and a very honest account of life as a model without sounding like bitching and moaning =o)",1
11894,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah, coming from a model. Fucking hypocrite.",1
11895,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Honestly, she should stop modeling with the information she&#39;s presenting. She&#39;s a total hypocrite. I don&#39;t need a model telling me about the difficulties and inequalities of image. I&#39;ve went to art school, been a designer for many years, and teach art/design. Looks are everything in today&#39;s society. I&#39;ve had the experience in advertising and the fine arts professions to prove it. Her hubris must so large that she needs some &quot;white guilt&quot; to pad it from utter shamelessness.",1
11896,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In my humble opinion I think part of what she is trying to leave a message is:<br>There is too many people losing their time in life trying to win the lottery (Modeling, sports, Hollywood, etc...) instead of doing what most people should do. which is study hard to get a degree while they are still young. the world would be a better place to all human beingsif society would make everyone think that higher education and knowledge was the coolest thing in the world. in a nutshell: fightingstatistics is pointless until is too late for those that did not win the DNA lottery or are losing their time trying<br><br>...if it makes sense...just an introverted thought",1
11897,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Life is naturally unfair. We&#39;re not equally cool or equally attractive. The sooner we accept this reality, the sooner we&#39;ll be liberated and content. Who ever you are, chances are you&#39;ve got something that another person would wish they had (like your healthy body). It&#39;s not good to always compare yourself with those who are better off than you. Extroverts get a lot more attention too so it&#39;s not just about looks. Everyone wants to hire the outspoken person which makes introverts feel less desirable in society. And considering the fact that personality is largely genetic too, it&#39;s just as unfair, but is that worst thing that could happen to someone?",1
11898,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she might be insecure but she sounds like a good person,1

11901,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One of the most powerful talks ever. Cameron shows us that not everyone is perfect. Models even think about how they look each day. In the end, its how the world interprets us, but we shouldn&#39;t get that get to us because even people who have the body shape you want still gets insecure. The only way to be content and have peace with happiness is to accpet the way we are and appreciate what we are given.",1

11906,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Where she get her fake tan?,1
11907,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s true that image is powerful, but look at the modelling industry andthe media? They have built an image that gives society the idea of &quot;how people esp females should look&quot;, or even &quot;how their skin colour should be?&quot;. They are the main influences, look at magazines, fashion shows, ads everything. Models have insecurity? I understand that, on the other hand I don&#39;t think they care or fully understand (of course, because it is a built industry) that their &#39;image&#39; creates a &#39;standard example&#39; of defining &amp; showing what &#39;beauty&#39; should look like and be - pressuring young girls or teens in believing that concept. So in the end, insecurity? models? naaa, look at the insecurities of those young girls, the society you are influencing, THATS the bigger picture.",1
11908,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s a tough issue. On the one hand, it&#39;s much easier to say &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; when you already look fucking awesome, call it modesty? On the other hand, you can&#39;t really say that statement if you look &quot;below par&quot; simply because people won&#39;t take you seriously claiming you are defending yourself.<br><br>To me, &#39;showing&#39; us how looks isn&#39;t everything instead of a beautiful woman &#39;telling&#39; us why it isn&#39;t everything is far more relevant.<br><br>Good looking people, in my opinion, has the edge over the rest simply because they are attractive (attractive in the sense that they get other people&#39;s attention much quicker) to other people, it&#39;s been demonstrated before.<br><br>It&#39;s not everything, but they naturally have an upper-hand.",1
11909,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What I got from this is that modeling is like pageants. You go through all of this crap. Having to make yourself look the best but to be turned away or even when you get the the reward (which is money) you lost a lot including being okay with the way you are, having to change your look.",1
11910,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What&#39;s the bottomline here? The final message cites &#39;Legacy plays a role in the way we are perceived and we perceive&#39;. Or is this tirade more on the contrast between the way we look and the invisible fragility inside? It is about insecurity? Well in that case I have to say that I think about how I look like every day but in a very different way! Because no matter how much my hair is shining and how thin my thighs are I still look ugly because of the rest of my body is objectively ugly. Does that make an insecure person of me? How insecure do you think I am or how insecure should I be according to this claim? I still think about the way I look every day, just like this lady! And I don&#39;t even get the social reassurances that she gets. The point is that confidence comes from other factors such as character and the way we succed in overcoming difficult situations and way less from the degree of attention to our personal appereance.",1
11911,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She speaks like a model, has worked hard at sounding intelligent but clearly out of her depth",1

11916,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"there was no sence in what she said, there was no meaning in what she said giving out flase hope is like she wanted to say i am the only one that can handle this job",1
11917,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I certainly agree with the message Cameron is espousing, but this begs the question, why are you a model? It would be one thing if she was a model before she became more educated and well versed on the deleterious influence media portrayal has on female self-image, but yet, she&#39;s still a model. She lambastes an industry where only 4 percent of the models are non-white, but yet, she&#39;s still a model. She still works for and makes money for the same industry that she is criticizing. She tells young girls &quot;why would you want to be a model, you can be anything&quot;, but yet, she&#39;s still a model. She could be anything (social worker, businesswoman, scientist), she could lead by example, but yet, she continues to represent a corrupt industry.<br><br>She tells us that the pictures of her that you see on the magazines are not really her, that they are only construction of a false reality and yet, she allows the industry to continue to reconstruct her for their own agenda. She tells us she gets stuff that she does not deserve for free, but yet she accepts it anyway. She didn&#39;t have to take that dress from Cambridge, and she certainly could have given it to someone else or sold it and given the money to those who deserve it more. And who knows, maybe she did, I wasn&#39;t there, but if she didn&#39;t, it certainly leaves a bad taste in ones mouth. She tell&#39;s us she is insecure because she has to think about what she looks like everyday. You are not trapped in this profession; you cannot be forced to grace the cover of magazines in scantly clad clothing.<br><br>There is a reason why a large majority of academics shun the mainstream media and the reason for that is education. Education of what it truly is that the media does to those too ignorant, vulnerable, lacking in education and those who have been exposed to cognitive predetermination&#39;s by social institutions put into place during their adolescent developmental years is what separates the intellectuals from the people they are trying to educate. The problem that Cameron faces is not her message; the message is golden and of great great significance. The deeper issue is that her message is currently hypocritical. If Cameron was truly passionate about promoting positive self-image she would not continue to work for this industry. She would never grace another cover of a magazine in an industry that propagates the kind of unhealthy messages she is fighting against. Do as I say not as I do. For Cameron to take the next step and be taken seriously as an intellectual, she needs to truly bite the hand that feeds her and get introspective and ask herself why she is still currently in this industry. Because as it stands, she&#39;s talking about the problem, but she&#39;s still contributing to the problem.  ",1

How come it&#39;s suddenly wrong to have a preferrence for white women?<br><br>If the market wants white models, it&#39;s a win-win. If you want to see black models, you can buy-fund the magazines and the media promoting them. But coming out and saying there&#39;s some kind of (deeeer duuuur) white privillege is at least ignorant.<br><br>Try a thought experiment: Go to a black man dating a white woman and tell him that he needs to date a black woman, because the white woman has &quot;unearned&quot; privillege.<br><br>You think you&#39;d sound stupid?

11926,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she had valid points, and her story is impacting. I don&#39;t think she was being a racist; she was being the exact opposite. I do think she&#39;s a bit narcissistic, but who isn&#39;t in this social media- controlled world? She hit a lot of points: being considered &quot;sexy&quot; because she is a thin, pretty, white girl; how she gets things in life for free for her physical appearance rather than anything else and etc. She was being the opposite of being racist, she ACKNOWLEDGED her privilege. I respect her so much for that. Many people won&#39;t acknowledge their privilege, we all have them. Some, more than others. Good job, Cameron. I see no mistakes here.<br><br>P.S. for the poster who said she was insecure, she said that she is insecure @ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=8m09s"">8:09</a> ",1
11927,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Here is my problem with Cameron&#39;s presentation. She&#39;s not really qualified to speak effectively on the subject of &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything.&quot; She comes from the far end ofthe spectrum where her looks allowed her to avoid much of the negatives experienced by people actually experience a certain amount of prejudice for not conforming to the standard aesthetic. I know really great women whose achievements would blow Cameron&#39;s bio out of the water. These women have had to overcome real obstacles, overcome cultural and societal impediments presented mostly by men and women that looked a lot like her. perhaps TED should put someone on that&#39;s more relateable to an experience of the topic.

That one style dress might not suit your shape but the next one might. Don&#39;t try and dress into something because its in style, dress in it because it looks good on YOU and makes you FFEL happy.

Her point is that there is more to her and just because she looks that way doesn&#39;t mean she can&#39;t have issues like everyone else. At the same time she understands what she gets. Someone once told me that you never know someone else situation until you step in there shoes. That the person that look like they have it together but doesn&#39;t really. I think before you sit there and talk about how your life is worst or how they have it all you should know them first. Plus models are pressured when it comes to there weight.

11963,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"My friend and I always go out together on friday nights. Some times we&#39;ll just go to a coffee shop. She&#39;ll go first and order a small coffee with 3 packets of sugar. I&#39;ll order a small coffee with some milk. One time her card got declined, the barista said its alright its on the house. A few weeks later we went back and I realized I forgot my wallet, the same barista told me he could hold my coffee while I went home to get my wallet. Thankfully my lovely friend had gotten paid that week and said she&#39;d take care of it. The barista told her she was so generous and gave us both for free. I don&#39;t want to say its because she&#39;s a pretty girl who wears a size two and has legs a hundred miles long. But this has happened many times and almost always the person who gives her the benefit is a man who finds her attractive but doesn&#39;t find me attractive because I&#39;m really pale, and I wear a size ten and kind of dorky glasses that make my eyes look too big for my face. And I even I get stopped on the streets by people telling me I&#39;m pretty, but I&#39;m only pretty if there isn&#39;t someone prettier to compare to, and in someways my being less attractive actually makes her look even better. But even with our male friends, she gets perks I don&#39;t. We&#39;ll go out for dinner and he&#39;ll pay for his and offer to pay for hers. He&#39;ll never offer to pay for mine, because he doesn&#39;t find me attractive. But even she has a friend who is taller and has longer legs and bigger breasts and a more conventionally attractive face who gets perks she doesn&#39;t. And so this piece really makes me think. I know that my friend has insecurities about how she looks, she thinks she&#39;s too slim and hates how long her legs are and doesn&#39;t like the shape of her face. She keeps telling me that she wishes she looked like me and &quot;actually had hips.&quot; But knowing a girl that a good portion of the straight male society finds attractive, and watching a piece about the power and downfalls of being beautiful and how its difficult to understand the racial and physical and social influences of beauty being a person who its socially the definition of beauty, it makes me wonder about what its like to navigate those implications being someone who isn&#39;t that definition. I can navigate it in a different way than my friend and she navigates it differently than hers. A model will navigate it differently than the rest of us, a woman of color will navigate it differently than someone who isn&#39;t. Different backgrounds navigate it differently, different socioeconomic groups navigate it differently. As do people of different weights, sexual orientations, regions of the country, regions of the world. But we can&#39;t really get what its like in a general sense until all these people make known their navigation through what it is to be pretty.",1
11964,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thank you for your honesty. You were touching in your sharing.,1

11968,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"OK, I&#39;m not trolling but what&#39;s the conclusion? I think this pretty lady would have shown an example if she wouldn&#39;t have become a model despite of her beauty. But she has been a model for 10 years, earnt a fortune just by walking up and down on the catwalk, and now, when she is getting too old for modelling or just wants to retire in her thirties (she can already do that because she has already earned enough money for the rest of her life), so now she is telling us that beauty is not everything. This is hypocrite. Her whole life shows us that to be a gorgeous woman is a huge advantage in every aspect of your life. What I am trying to highlight is that I have the same impression about this which was shown in the film Good Will Hunting. If you haven&#39;t watched the film, it&#39;s about a young genius who born with his outstanding talent and did nothing for it. He is smarter than any professor and can do any type of job but he works in constructions and lives in the slum, because his talent is not valuable for him. Ok, this is the same with her beauty, it has no value for her but once again: if there is no value for her why did she become a modell and not anything else? And BTW I&#39;m a 24 year-old-guy, not an ugly raging MILF, but this is my opinion. And sorry for my English it is not my first language.",1

I love looking at my favorite models do the runway even though I don&#39;t have their legs, Its there for enjoyment, not for self evaluation. Find the middle ground. I never thought of models as being beautiful, really. Most of them are a bit odd looking. They are a components of a lovely photo.Cameron however, is whiny, not sufficiently wise, and been drinking the liberal Koolaid a bit too long.

11981,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Here are the problems with one of her points (the one about 200 yrs of racial beauty standards):<br><br>1. The fashion industry is run by caucasians who (like all humans) have an inborn preference toward those like their own. And were the industry run by a different shade of people then we&#39;d have the same problem.<br><br>2. She, naively, believes that what the industry thinks is beautiful is naturally what all people think is beautiful. <br><br>But this is the worst part; like so many of these social-justice ted talks, she spends all her time complaining about a problem WITHOUT presenting any form of solution. <br><br>Side note: stop and frisk is totally fucked up and a violation of the 4th amendment.",1

Oh, my, it must be sooo difficult to travel to exotic places in the world frolic about for a couple of hours,eat at great restaurants and vacation at resorts. Yes, after all the life of a model must be so much more difficult than working construction, working in a coal mine, working on an oil platform, or being a car mechanic. Or working REAL jobs that contribute far more to society with little ay lie being a high school teacher.<br><br>But somehow I&#39;m suppose to accept that models are the most insecure people on the planet?

And suddenly near the (presumably) tail end of a career that has only elevated her to other opportunities most are denied with far more merit, she has the nerve to miraculously acquire a conscience and lecture the very people who work harder, longer and with less to show for it about insecurities? I have only one question. Cameron, when you were a model and having such a tough time enjoying the perks of privilege just on your looks, did you cash the checks they gave you? If so, then you&#39;re not qualified to lecture anybody about looks aren&#39;t everything.",1

12022,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"amazing talk, u r so brave standing out and saying this.<br><br>actually i am a muslim girl, none muslims keep critisizing Hijab (muslim women modest wear and head cover), but in fact it&#39;s most beneficial for the woman for u don&#39;t allow people to judge u by looks ,instead u let them forget a little bit that u r a &quot;woman&quot; and focus on ur personality and Brain!<br>some student&#39;s in Jordan university made a questioner for Girls for study purposes, and they found out that girls who don&#39;t wear hijab have the lowest self esteem, those who wear hijab have more self esteem, but those who got the highest records are the women who cover their faces not only their hair!<br>interesting to know, because she who chose to cover her face cares less about what people think, and in most cases she has the prettiest face as well!",1
12023,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So well spoken and articulated! I love her.,1
12024,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i think this talk is just so insightful. kudos for her and her honesty, i think it is so admirable",1
12025,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She says a few things that are just stupid &quot;be president of the united states or be my boss&quot;, like that&#39;s any easier than trying to become a model. But half of the talk was good, just half.",1
12026,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The title is so paradoxical,<br>&quot;I am pretty, that is why i am allowed to judge about the value of beauty.&quot;<br>(&quot;Ugly&quot; people don&#39;t have the authority to talk about this = beauty matters)",1
12027,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So, you are telling us that the woman that appears in those photos is not truly you, but a collaborated work of a group of people that make you look like a goddess. This is definitely something that I think most people know by now about the modeling industry. Yet a lot of girls suffer for the standards that this industry puts in people minds about what really beauty is and should be every day. How come you are still part of this &quot;fake&quot; business if you are completely aware of the consequences? You are pretty much just telling us just how it sucks to be beautiful, skinny and privileged in my opinion.",1
12028,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;d say most people who feel unattractive would be sorted if they just hit the gym and sorted out their clothes and hair.,1
12029,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think about this speech a lot. God, people are so ignorant.",1
12030,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She completely defied my expectations in such a short time. I thought, as the title of the talk lead me to believe, that she would wax poetic about the importance of personality. So glad I was wrong. This turned out to be an amazing talk.",1
12031,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,TRULY INSPIRATIONAL,1
12032,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It was so good, to hear her talk about this world and herself so honest, I just loved it. Wish it was longer",1
12033,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;not picture of me, they are construction ... &quot; wow - shes smart and pretty ... and sweet and funny? great talk C.R.!!!",1
12034,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Being a model is interesting, but its also really creepy.<br>Because they don&#39;t care about you as a person. If you dont fit in their box, theyll find someone else. I got an extra 2 hours of work at <b>not gonna say the name of the company</b> just because I was a few inches taller than the other boys.",1
12035,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she is exposing her bloodline. there is no way to be a model like her unless you have a bloodline that was built. she is not even a human, a reptilian, that feels bad.",1
12036,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is like Warren Buffet going to Africa to lecture poor people that life is not about the money,1
12037,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wish this was longer. This was really good. ,1
12038,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok Im black and did no get offended,because she shows acknowledgement in the fact that &#39;&#39;white pretty girls&#39;&#39; (according to society)Get farther and away with a heck of a lot more that women of different nationalities.Its a sad truth but true.Doesnt mean women wont fight back,but we first have to know what we are dealing with.That we all notice.<br><br>Stop calling her a racist,she isnt.",1
12039,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Bullshit. Your looks are not just some counterbalance to your personality - they are integral part of who you are. Being ashamed of winning genetic lottery is stupid, since that&#39;s how nature performs its selection. Insecurity always comes with a constant need to reassure your fitness to certain criteria, because people are naturally wary of risks.",1
12040,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think she is a beautiful woman. It&#39;s crazy how many white modelz their are. What she said about beauty is true nd all. I am dominican and spain lot&#39;s of people white and other nationality said I am really really good looking preety boy and I am also tall lik 6 foot 1 and a hslf to 6&quot;2 and musclar also I get judge as a player or girls get scare to talk to me bc they don&#39;t feel pretty enough. It&#39;s all about the inside I date beautiful girls with ugly personalitie. She trying to say is don&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover ,1
12041,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. However, Our minds conform to constant pounding and repetition. So if the media constantly portrays what is quote &quot;beautiful&quot; we will eventually conform to the the idea subconsciously.",1
12042,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sorry, but I don&#39;t like the UNDERLYING message of this video. Please, if I completely missunderstood, feel free to correct me (and if so, my apologies for what I am about to say also go to the young lady in the video)<br><br>Now, first of, let me say that she seems hypocritical to me. Why? Well, she wants to make it seem like she kinda dislikes that everything is superficial, thus portraiting herself as a &#39;good&#39; person who TRIES to stand above superficially judging people or herself. Thus she tries to show her own &#39;noble&#39; striving towards freedom of vanity, it seems. Yet, throughout the video, I couldn&#39;t help but feel that secretly she actually wanted to rub in to us how lucky she was. Like, when she was saying sth along the lines of &#39;&#39;It&#39;s so unfair, I&#39;m only privilged because I&#39;m a pretty, white girl&#39;&#39; - I don&#39;t know, that sounds pretty vain to me. Again, if I missunderstood, I am deeply sorry, but that is the impression this video left me with.<br><br>But that&#39;s not my main point. The problem is the underlying message. She basically suggests that either you are lucky and you&#39;re born with the perfect looks or you are not and there is basically very little chance of ever improving your situation. That message right there is extremely discouraging to many, and also wrong. Not everyone is just gonna accept it like &#39;&#39;oh, I think I look bad, but now it&#39;s okay because the lady said it&#39;s not right to think looks are important anyways&#39;&#39;.<br><br>Now, let me start of by saying that I think humans do have some sort of an influence on their outer appearance that goes beyond pure genetics (and i DON&#39;T mean plastic surgery, nonono!). There&#39;s so many things factoring in on this, for instance: one&#39;s perception of himself/herself, relations to people you grow up with, what you eat, neurotic behavior (or rather NO neurotic behavior), just to name a few of these factors.<br>Just reducing the looks to a matter of genes is plain wrong, and could probably discourage some people quite a bit. Besides, people carry several &#39;hidden&#39; genes which can be deactivated or activated by certain circumstances/lifestyles.<br><br>Besides, I don&#39;t like the whole &#39;&#39;I feel so bad about it but I do it anyways&#39;&#39; vibe and the &#39;&#39;It&#39;s sooo unfair that police men and people in general treat me better because I&#39;m so pretty&#39;&#39; - sorry, still sounds vain and hypocritical (again, as I was saying above, speak up and correct me if I&#39;m wrong)<br><br>Lastly, why on earth would she tell us <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM4Xe6Dlp0Y&amp;t=5m44s"">5:44</a>? Also, all those pictures of her life, like a slide show. I know, it&#39;s her profession to &#39;&#39;exhibit&#39;&#39; herself (sorry if I used incorrect word), but that still seems so... narcissistic... in a way. If I am wrong, feel free to enlighten me, but well, that&#39;s the impression I had :P",1
12043,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are a fool if you think this talk is helping her financially.,1
12044,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You&#39;re missing the point. Whites have an arbitrarily favored legacy and that is her whole point... There is no flaw in her argument even if she was nervous about it. She is saying that she realizes better than anyone how superficial the favoritism skinny white girls in general receive just because of the most recent empire-building. Skinny white girls are the current global fetish and people have an incongruent and unfounded admiration and respect and envy of them or anything close to it (yes, like Tyra banks even... Notice how celebrity Blacks generally speak and act with &#39;white&#39; mannerisms)",1
12045,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m sure it is important to her.....I&#39;m not so sure the babbling of beauty is important to the rest of us......the phony world of phony images....seems....well....phony.,1
12046,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Being good-looking isn&#39;t everything, but it got me on TED on Youtube with little to no work....because of my looks.&quot;<br><br>Yes, being good-looking is extremely significant.",1
12047,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Loved the message.,1
12048,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Gotdamn I feel so bad for this girl. Boohoo!,1
12049,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was very heart-touching and pure talk. Thanks to her honesty and confidence of course.,1
12050,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is one of the most meaningful talks I&#39;ve heard. Thank you for being so open and honest and sharing your heart with us. God bless you.,1
12051,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Answer yourself this. What video would you rather watch?<br><br>a) &quot;Money isn&#39;t everything. Believe me. I&#39;m rich&quot;<br>b) &quot;Money isn&#39;t everything. Believe me. I&#39;m poor&quot;<br><br>(a) is the equivalent of this video. Totally worthless. (b) would be a valuable video.,1
12052,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I didn&#39;t get the dress thing. It&#39;s not that big a change, is it?",1
12053,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am proud of the consciousness she has and the agency she mustered up to talk about her privileges, but also the vulnerability to talk about the societal oppression she faces. A great model of what it means to be human.",1
12054,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Would you prefer more uglies in the world? I don&#39;t think so!,1
12055,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t have a problem with superficial beauty. I don&#39;t consider it as something &quot;bad&quot;. It&#39;s entertaining, it&#39;s fun and that is fine to me. If you do want to interact with a person with the kind of interaction that may require you to know more about the personality of that individual, then you do have to look past superficial beauty and associated prejudices and cliche&#39;s. I am able to do that with the people I meet in life (thankfully) but what I&#39;m getting at is that we need to change <i>our</i> perception and association of superficiality with &quot;shallowness&quot; of a person and understand not to resort to mentally stereotyping people based off of superficial beauty but digging deeper before forming an opinion on people.",1
12056,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t get the point .-.,1
12057,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s a great person to say all these things,1
12058,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"With one TED talk, Cameron Russell has given better advice and thus done more for young girls than that self-absorbed, tactless, media-obsessed fool Tyra Banks has done in over twenty seasons of her ridiculous reality series that misleads young people into thinking they can be high-fashion models. Cameron: &quot;It [becoming a model] is out of your control, and it&#39;s awesome and it&#39;s NOT a career-path.&quot;",1
12059,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lets be honest, she&#39;s not that attractive. I prefer a youngClaudia Cardinale/Ann-Margret myself.",1
12060,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. To me, there is no definition of beauty because everyone sees it differently. That&#39;s exactly why it&#39;s not okay to call someone ugly, that person might be the hottest thing ever to somebody else..",1
12061,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Actually there is a lot you can do to change how you look. Diet (as in eating healthy), exercise, and positive thinking will go a long way",1
12062,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Her liberal conditioning shown through that&#39;s for sure. The liberal narrative has conditioned this poor girl not to even be able to appreciate her own looks and career without somehow feeling guilty and believing she must be part of some unfair group and owes something back to everyone. <br><br>Lot&#39;s of women get off of a ticket for crying, smiling etc. if pulled by a male police.<br><br>There aren&#39;t as many black models because our culture finds white women more attractive as a general rule, otherwise there would be more black models. Unlike liberal &quot;theory&quot; I can assure you the fashion industry relies on facts to gain profit and they are choosing the models that will gain them profit! Money translates into numbers and numbers don&#39;t lie.<br><br>Frankly, I didn&#39;t get the point of her talk but I did see her liberal conditioning had produced what appeared to be a very confused woman who admitted being one of the most insecure people there are.<br><br>I wonder what she will do when her looks fade?",1
12063,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a fabulous woman. I think with more confidence she could really grow into something absolutely amazing.,1
12064,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wonderful,1
12065,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Like her perspective,1
12066,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A model with problems? Boo hoo. trust me sweetie, you haven&#39;t got problems.",1
12067,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;ve always disliked models, girls who think they&#39;re models or attractive girls in general. It&#39;s an incredibly sexist and slightly misogynistic thing to say, but it&#39;s the truth. Why? Like Russell points out, they get things handed to them. A lot of them never have to work for things, and they get told how amazing and attractive all the time. But it speaks nothing of their personality or worth. The world needs more people like Cameron. People who think and realise what&#39;s more important.",1
12068,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is incredible.,1
12069,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I still wouldn&#39;t mind having her life. If she tried to convince me that beauty is not important, idk, I don&#39;t see her struggling because of being too pretty. Her presentation could use more depth.",1
12070,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great,1
12071,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When she said that models are the most insecure. Reminded me of a quote from Gattaca that went something like &quot;they&#39;ve got you looking so hard for any flaw, that now that&#39;s all you see&quot;.",1
12072,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;For the past few centuries we have defined beauty as...white skin&quot;. <br>No, for the past few centuries, ignorant white people have defined beauty as &quot;white skin&quot;. ",1
12073,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Racism is bad. Don&#39;t do drugs. Sexism is bad. Look both ways when crossing the road. Don&#39;t take candy from a stranger.  Wow who writes her speeches.... oh she does.,1
12074,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,They told me i could be anything i wanted.<br><br>So i became a clarinet.,1
12075,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She sounds so honest. I believe she&#39;s genuine and good for her that she&#39;s so open.,1
12076,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She sounds so honest. I believe she&#39;s genuine and good for her that she&#39;s so open.,1
12077,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Truly inspiring!,1
12078,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,it&#39;s such an inspiration! next please have Bill gates for Mark talking about Money means nothing! :P,1
12079,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What a complete waste of time. Oh, the modeling world is superficial and prejudice? How insightful. Let&#39;s give her a talk on her monumental struggles.",1
12080,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"its really a truth tht we feel uncomfortable on one hand but on anotha hand we actully know that hello look at me,,,,m a successful being,,,,nd if amn&#39;t then i wil be,,,BELIEVE IN UH,,",1
12081,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love this and thank you! This echoes the sentiment of every woman ever, no matter her external beauty. The only cure to this aliment is intellectual confidence and compassion/love/generosity to the ones around us ",1
12082,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,awesome,1
12083,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for your honesty.,1
12084,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I do not feel she was being racist she was stating that the majority or models are white,1
12085,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s really intelligent. and she has a different way on seeing things. kudos to her!,1
12086,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,got it guys!,1
12087,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;But mostly, it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppresion when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries. . . If there&#39;s a takeaway to this talk, I hope it&#39;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures.&quot; - Cameron Russell, model",1
12088,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is like Warren Buffet telling people that people shouldn&#39;t be rich, despite insisting on keeping his billions of dollars.",1
12089,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,They showed us this video in school ,1
12090,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"They tell me I can become anything, but they won&#39;t let me rule the world...",1
12091,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"my main goal in life is to help these young women. self esteem, body image, self worth, everything. great talk, Cameron is lovely",1
12092,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Nice talk, but I feel this should have gone a little longer. Its a little short and rushed, imo.",1
12093,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"From the wiki page, &quot;Cameron Russell was born in Boston, and raised in Cambridge.[3] Her mother is Robin Chase, founder of Zipcar. Her father is an engineer and CEO of GoLoco, a car-pooling and social networking company.&quot;",1
12094,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she has stunning beauty, although a well trained ear can tell right away that she&#39;s insecure",1
12095,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I like this. Some good points here.,1
12096,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,they said don&#39;t judge the book by its cover.. but honestly a good cover can take u much further..,1
12097,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I like people that aren&#39;t afraid of telling things or expressing their feelings, the way they experience or see it. Not giving &quot;politically correct&quot; answers all the damn time or robotic/puppeteer responses because of what &quot;majority&quot; thinks.",1
12098,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"true words but not exactly awe inspiring, surprising or interesting.",1
12099,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"okay, i found a model that i actually wants to marry than i just want to bang",1
12100,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks r evrything<br>,1
12101,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I like her point that the modeling industry is superficial and shallow, and how she will continue to be a part of it.",1
12102,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"An age lottery is very evident as well. When she gets over 30, her next talk should be &quot;Women Over 30: Why Men are No Longer Pursuing, nor Bothering to Talk to You Anymore&quot;.",1
12103,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she seems racist though ... she said several times &#39;&#39;WHITE SKIN &#39;&#39; while describing the beauty of women .,1
12104,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You all judge people quickly cause she is model doesn&#39;t mean you are stupid and brainless fucking idiots,1
12105,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was awesome!!! ,1
12106,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this is incredibly amazing! what an inspirational young woman!! wish there were more honest people like this in our world!,1
12107,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you Cameron Russell!,1
12108,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"An incredible amount of shallow off and base comments over a very straightforward concept: image is power. (notice the period) <del>and</del> Look a little closer at perceived success&#39;s and perceived failures.<br>Her whole speech makes me think of all the times I&#39;ve judged someone based on the way they look : race, attractiveness, wealth ect. Makes me feel I need to be more conscious of how media affects my perception of others, and constantly consider how valid that perception is.",1
12109,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron Russell wouldn&#39;t be able to stand up there and say &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; if she was a short, ugly, fat girl.",1
12110,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,To me it sounded like she has a guilty conscience for being privileged. I appreciate her gesture but is this absolution going to benefit anybody else than herself?,1
12111,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She seems like a sweet down to earth girl.,1
12112,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y," ,       ,   ,         ))  .",1
12113,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is a very fuzzy speech. Cameron goes from telling people not to judge based on the clothes they wear, too how unfair it is for pretty girls to be given nice things just for being pretty, too racist... am I the only one who noticed how flawed her argument is?<br><br>She starts off with how you shouldn&#39;t judge based on people appearance through fashion... I should now stop judging and avoiding boys for wearing their pants to their knees because that&#39;s just not nice... It&#39;s like how we naturally avoid quacks like Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus in public... we should just stop because it&#39;s mean. OK.<br><br>Theres a HUGE difference between giving people special attention for being beautiful (which is a VERY NATURAL thing to do) and a police officer letting someone off the hook for being pretty.<br><br>And the part about racism, yes you shouldn&#39;t mistreat someone simply because of the hue of their skin, any humane decent person would agree and support civil rights among races in society, but all that just doesn&#39;t fit in with this speech. It&#39;s like shes saying pretty white people are treated better then people from other races, and that&#39;s just not true. We all spit on each others faces all the time. Within our own race more then others.<br><br>I wonder how people would have reacted to this if it was a male model complaining about cougars showering men with special attention and gifts, LOL!",1
12114,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was point less,1
12115,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m just gonna say it... Muslim women have been saying this very thing for CENTURIES.... Muahaha I have spoken,1
12116,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m a man and I like beautiful women and I&#39;m not going to apologize for it. I wouldn&#39;t expect a woman to apologize for liking a strong and confident man. It&#39;s biology. It&#39;s evolution. It&#39;s human nature. It&#39;s got nothing to do with the &quot;media&quot;. Anybody who thinks otherwise is fooling themselves.<br>,1
12117,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"My wife was a model before we met, and she tells almost the exact same &quot;story&quot; that the entire lifestyle is superficial and contrived. I have no reason to doubt this spealer at all.",1
12118,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I MODELED HOSE.GARDEN HOSE,1
12119,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,To be honest she&#39;s not that sexy anyway. It&#39;s much better to just exercise and stay fit rather than to take pills or whatever it is that models do to make themselves look like brittle bones. ,1
12120,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she&#39;s right, but it&#39;s so hard to change my mindset. whenever I see a tall white girl, the first thing I think is how to get her in my bed.",1
12121,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very truthful and she connects with us because she is willing to look at her life and those around her deeply and sincerly.,1
12122,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she is right,1
12123,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Heartfelt emotional speech. But there was nothing interesting about it.,1
12124,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,oh man that talk felt so short i wish she went on for longer or more models do this,1
12125,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Very Inspirational and eye opening, I truly appreciate the speaker&#39;s honesty. I think it is very important for every woman or girl to realize her worth is not earned according to how pretty she is, her worth is never at mercy of how she looks. I would say beauty should only be an expression of a woman&#39;s tremendous value BY DEFAULT.It&#39;s so eye opening to know the shear amount of insecurities and fear a woman experience by not realizing/believing her worth and value and therefore having her worth depend upon something so fragile and destined to be lost in time.",1
12126,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When you really go to school and walk around New York where mostly white people are and then you go to Brazil or the islands. You&#39;ll see that colored (Latina, indian, Black etc.) look way better. Most white girls usually tend to have less curves and all they usually have is nice hair and a nice face. White girls are kinda getting boring. It&#39;s just that the media gives them all this credit but they really aren&#39;t as amazing as it makes them seem. In my opinion even asian girls are starting to look better than white girls.",1

12129,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Don&#39;t buy into the liberal idea that you should be ashamed of your successes. ,1
12130,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I know I am a guy but I feel like a lot of what she has said can be transferred to a male perspective. I am a 23 year old guy who has only grown into my looks and from what I&#39;ve personally experienced we truly live in a shallow world. From the ages of 16 until 21-22 I was an awkward looking thing; weedy with a narrow long face. During that phase the reception and general judgement I would receive from people tended to be dismissive. Now that I have blossomed into someone of an average build and am now apparently aesthetically considered&#39; above average&#39; (whatever that means) the manner in which the world perceives me has transformed. Now all of a sudden women are more forgiving of my faults and mistakes and I&#39;ve now become more desirable to the opposite sex. When I dwell on how different my life is just because of my outward appearance it really fills me with real sadness. Looks shouldn&#39;t matter but unfortunately due to the media&#39;s constant indoctrination of what is considered conventionally appealing people do give greater gravitas to appearance.,1
12131,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Models are that she did are marketed to &#39;Westerern&#39; publications! So the high majority of white models, and the high majority of white viewers. The same as the high Japanese models for Japan Mags etc...Western views!!! She needs to stop putting these views on others! This is a view of advertisers for 200+ years, and I, and I can say we (for many), can say I will buy clothes from an add with a &#39;NORMAL&#39; model if the clothes are nice...Don&#39;t believe me? Look at the most beautiful woman voted the last 20 or so years ago, can&#39;t remember any super skinny like &#39;Fashion Models&#39;???",1
12132,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Pretty woman is treated as a sex object not as a person!,1
12133,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m not sure I really learned anything from this talk. I still enjoyed it because it&#39;s not every day you hear a model give such an honest self-assessment so articulately. So that was interesting.,1
12134,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very profound presentation. simple and beautiful. I am a Black woman and I really feel what she is saying those images are so damaging. Women are wearing destructive contact lens and using lightning cream and so many Black boys are harassed and arrested. A family member straight A honor roll pulled down off his bike handcuffed and yanked to the ground and aclled names before neighbors before being let go. for what? because he is black and male. this is at 13 years old. so I am very much appreciative of this presentation...we have to think and change...things...,1
12135,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bravo :Applause:,1
12136,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Cameron the planet needs oil so the metal in the earth can spin again,1
12137,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,<br>Inspiring. Such a powerfull speech. I love it,1
12138,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,We love this Ted Talk. Eye-opening.,1
12139,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"hi cameron. every time i feel sad - especially about my looks, i open this video. you&#39;re right :) and i would totally vote you for president of united states - even if you were a model!",1
12140,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That took a lot of courage. We can all learn something from this. Images are powerful and in our society are used to spread propaganda designed to take money from you and I.My hatis goes off foryou Cameron Russell for speaking truth!,1
12141,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Possible, not probable&gt;",1
12142,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She speaks the truth. It really is such a shame that as a collective (at least here in the west) we have allowed superficial BS like the way someone looks to judge others. I personally broke that a few years ago by understanding that beauty does not equal happiness &amp; my life has changed for the better. It&#39;s very easy actually, never judge someone based on the way they look &amp; get to know them for who they are. I&#39;ve dated a couple of girls who were models before but as they were empty inside by only caring about BS like celebrities, TV, movies etc, it never lasted &amp; I would never date a girl based on looks again. My advice to women (&amp; even some men) in these comments is to work on yourself &amp; who you are, learn to love &amp; look after yourself, spend time helping those less fortunate than you &amp; everything else will fall into place as if by magic. That&#39;s been my experience anyway &amp; I wish I learnt this when I was young but better late than never :)",1
12143,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,good talk. too bad about all the comments...,1
12144,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,buhu im pretty,1
12145,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Of course there are smart women who go into modeling... But those are just the minority. Look at those dumb bimbos in those pageant shows... Look at those who are in runway shows... Most people who chose their career in life as a model are because of two things. One is vanity. Two is number one. And what leads to this vanity? Environment and poor upbringings. Why?<br><br>Pretty girls get adored, get more glances, get more attention, get more affection. For that, they started to put more and more attention on their appearances as they grow up. Overtime, as they understand what lies out there in the society, they have the underlying notion that they can still go into modeling even if they fail in class. With such a safety net, why would they work hard?<br><br>Parents who are over relaxedin bringing up their kids, can never shape their kidsinto a particular type of person or of much calibre. If you let a kid do what he or shewants, and the kid grew up with no ambition or goal in life, why wouldn&#39;t he or she take up modeling? Imparting the right core values to a person while young is important.<br><br>Now about a model being smart.. Sure, this model thinks more, and considered more about life, but is that truly smart? Smartis an issue of relativity, and she is just &#39;smarter&#39; than a lot of models out there...",1
12146,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I attribute a substantial amount of my ongoing GAD and depression over the past decade due to stress about looks. The fact is that the better looking you are, ceteris paribus, the better treated you are, the more trusted you are, the more you can get away with, the less time you have to spend on yourself and the more you will earn. Life is so much easier. No amount of self-delusion through positive thinking will change those facts. This video did nothing to take my mind off that fact. 1. She still looked as beautiful with or without that clothing change. 2. Models are only insecure because they&#39;re models, not because they&#39;re beautiful. Life is extremely unfair, and the advantages of being beautiful far outweigh any of the disadvantages (that aren&#39;t in fact explained in this video).",1
12147,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I was quite surprised when I started dating a few models that some of them are actually quite intelligent and down to earth.,1
12148,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She looks like Eva Mendez! ,1
12149,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Awesome speech! There is A Lot one can do about the way that they look... body shaping, inner-beauty, psychological intervention..<br>Thank you for sharing.:D",1
12150,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This really got to me because I&#39;m overweight and I&#39;m so insecure but no one knows. I just keep it to myself because what am I supposed to do? No one and I mean NO ONE knows what its like to have all of these sisters who had a lot of boyfriends and can eat whatever they want a can still fit in jeans from three years ago but on the other hand I can&#39;t even fit into the pants I got for Christmas.Sometimes I just feel like a worthless fat blob and I probably will never have confidence again. I mean, yeah talks like this get to me but that only lasts for a couple days.Just to tell you, saying &quot;It will be alright&quot; doesn&#39;t make it better. at this point words don&#39;t help anymore. Its just like stabbing yourself in the stomach and saying &quot;Stop bleeding&quot;. I&#39;m not saying this for pity or attentin, I just needed to let myself out",1
12151,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This had me in tears. Wow! Such courage to be able to come out and talk about the truth behind all of the glamour that young girls and women aspire to each day. I love how you made it clear that image matters a lot but looks aren&#39;t everything. Because truth is, we live in a society where you are constantly judged by the way you look instead of who you are and what you have to offer as a person. We completely dehumanize and objectify people such that people (especially women) grow up with all these insecurities. Also, this helped me see another side to models. That they are not all superficial air-heads who just nod and smile. Thank you Cameron. You are an inspiration!",1

Thank you for your message and your inspiration, and keep up the good work!",1
12159,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she still looks very pretty after putting on the frumpy dress and regular shoes. You could probably have a magazine with women in provocative poses wearing regular clothes, and it might sell very well--maybe even better than the usual fare, who knows? I wish I could automatically have the looks of a model without taking the time to groom myself--looking good, even shaving, takes a lot of time that can be spent on other things, like watching TED talks! ",1
12160,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bravo! That was truly amazing Cameron Russell!,1
12161,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She looks like a tall Eva Mendes.,1
12162,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Amazing talk.such honesty.loved the change of look..actually preferred her look when she changed..,1
12163,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She did a good job. It makes sense that she was worried what people would perceive her as, and because of that she really had to tip toe around her point to ensure people weren&#39;t thinking &quot;Oh you&#39;re beautiful and if you have a problem with something it likely doesn&#39;t deserve our attention.&quot; Beautiful women don&#39;t have it as easy as so many people think.",1
12164,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m sorry to say this but looks do matter if someone can change my mind please do so. Thank you.,1

12169,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i hope my female students are listening to this....,1
12170,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was n excellent speech......powerful,1
12171,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yes, looks are not everything. but why apologize for what you do and the images that have been made of you, when at the end of the day, you are still cashing in on this privileged lifestyle? so, you are a nice model, but it does not change anything that is wrong with the industry.",1
12172,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Outstanding,1
12173,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Talking about the aspects ofwhat people consider beautiful,from the mouthof someone who &quot;knows&quot; they are one of those people, can be a very uncomfortable topic. I applaud her for it.Sheknows it to be true because she is obviouslyhired to do the job. We assume that if you recognize yourself to be good looking by other&#39;s standards, and you know that you fit the bill, that you are arrogant, and probably stupid as well .Or, it&#39;s as if you think....&quot;this woman is the reason that people feel bad about themselves....everyone is beautiful,and it&#39;s only because of magazines that we givegrowing girls a false self image, that costs them theiridentify as a smart person, or a strong CEO, etc... &quot;and thus she is the target for us toalmost say....it&#39;s her fault thatgirls make a bit less than men onaverage.(though she makes more..)Anyway, I think it&#39;s actually abrilliant anddifficult topic to capture. I like that she said that it was a lottery of random characteristics that got her the job.",1
12174,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its easy for she to say ... shes fucking hot.,1
12175,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Image is superficial. We have defined that beauty is tall and white, not youthful symmetric and healthy as we are genetically programmed to think. I commend her for realizing, and letting people know what a big lie the beauty standard is. She&#39;s beautiful and intelligent.",1
12176,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Her message is a good one, but I don&#39;t see how she can admit to having won &quot;a genetic lottery&quot;. Like most top models, she&#39;s so ... THIN. To me, that&#39;s not winning&quot;a genetic lottery&quot;.",1
12177,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In my opinion,simplicity is the ultimate luxury.Removing the high heels speak volumes about you.Great talk.",1

12179,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything, i get free stuff cause i look great, load of money for basically doing nothing because i look great... what? Oh wait, she is insecure, there we go.",1
12180,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What an intelligent person,1

12188,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y," Man I am just really happy to be a visitor here on this planet, Because you Earthlings are just fucking crazy. I wounder if this is how Captain Cook felt just before he was eaten. Do you suppose he apologized for being white meat. LMAO  ",1
12189,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Are people retarded? She didn&#39;t get all those benefits cause she is white. She got free stuff and was let off on police fines because she is hot. If you were a black, latino, asian, arabic or whatever hot chick you&#39;d get the same treatment too.. I&#39;m white and I don&#39;t get any free stuff, I also always get checked at airports, never been let off on a fine, never got given free stuff, etc.. People got to stop using the race card. Its the 21st century no one gives a shit what color your skin is.",1
12190,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Awesome! The willingness to expose the core truth of one&#39;s existence at the cellular level has to be applauded. These rare occasions of pure honesty affirm my faith in deep introspection. Thank you Cameron.,1
12191,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Silly- Men who know beauty- know a pretty women in sweats, greasy hair and no make up. No matter the race- men like what they like. Because of technology in the last 50 years- modeling became an industry. 100 years ago- no one would get rich being pretty except with marriage. Same for actors and singers. Stupid to admire them- new technology made them ultimately. Yes, I am glad she is honest, smart and has a sense of humor. So does Lena dunham and I love how she shows her &quot;normal women&quot; body off all the time. Really, she is addressing shallow people who do not already get this.",1
12192,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When she first came out I thought to myself, oh great a model coming to talk about stupid shit. Then she put that skirt and sweater on overtop of her dress.. AND SHE COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT HER 10 SECONDS. Though she brought up several important topics, she failed to really explain any of them. She basically said she&#39;s lucky that shes hot but she still feels insecure. And she also stated that non-caucasian people get harrassed by police more often. Now I&#39;m not calling her stupid. But, for any of you that feel the need to defend her. Don&#39;t tell me how I&#39;m stupid or I missed her point unless you can explain to me what her point was. The way I took this speech, was that shes an insecure model.. She could have talked about the eating disorders and drug problems that models have. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve seen some really powerful Ted speeches, and unfortunately this is just not an intelligent speech.",1
12193,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, you wanted to share the world that the images of you aren&#39;t you. Good point.<br><br>But,You can&#39;t spit into the well you&#39;re drinking from. The choice of modeling was yours. Some quit after a short period, because of the jobs&#39; requirements and restrictions, you have done it for 10 years. Every job has its&#39; benefits and its&#39; deficiencies. You can&#39;t whine about it now.<br><br>I&#39;m sure that contrary to others mentioned you had a choice. So just thank your parents for what you are and try to make the best out of you. You seem like a very nice person, and I think you can still be pretty much everything you wanted to be.<br><br>And do you really want to be a president? Why? Because of the power and the recognition? Would it make you happy? They have to deal constantly with stress, being on the media. Away from family and constantly followed by guards. Are presidents whining about that?",1
12194,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks like Hilary Swank,1
12195,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why is she breathing so hard at first I wonder? I thought maybe she was nervous. Maybe talking in front of people is different than walking along the catwalk. But it is good to see a model with brains.,1

She is a beauty and will always be better than the rest of us &quot;ugly non-model types.&quot; Don&#39;t doubt thatfor a second that she wouldn&#39;t be with a fellow Male model.

I wouldn&#39;t call myself a positive person, but by viewing the comments, I&#39;ve come to realize that there are always someone who&#39;s on another level of negativity. When you find someone who can&#39;t even try to sympathize or shut up and listen long enough to think about what she&#39;s saying, you realize...what a bunch of fuck nuggets...<br>One, they call her superficial<br>Two, they call her racist, or unappreciative of her skin color<br>Three, they claim that she put herself in the situation<br>Four, none of you can know what she experienced, that&#39;s why she&#39;s trying to explain...<br>Five, she was a teenager when she was scouted.

Let&#39;s all just be blunt here though. If you&#39;re naturally pretty, than you will generally be treated better. It&#39;s a fact. People like to befriend, look at, hire,be with attractive people. That&#39;s why models are attractive! That&#39;s why movie stars are hot! It&#39;s sad but it&#39;s true. Although the perception of beauty has evolved throughout the years and throughout different cultures, the importance of outward beauty hasn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know how we can fix this--gouge out everyone&#39;s eyes?",1
12235,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything, says the model. Beautiful people have it easy, they&#39;re more likely to get employed more likely to date and more likely to get treated better. Though I find looks to be shallow and don&#39;t base my friendships and relationships on them, I do believe that if you&#39;re beautiful then you have it easy and you complaining about how &#39;insecure&#39; you feel just sounds like whining to me. Life is not so hard when you&#39;re getting paid big bucks to pose in front of a camera. I appreciate her point of view, very well spoken speech, but coming from her just seems invalid to me since she had never lived without her looks.

12240,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People who you think would be the Least insecure, sometimes are the most insecure of all. <br><br>humans are so complex, so many layers to us. Even subconsciously things we dont know about self",1
12241,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"please fill in my friends survey,<br><a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/5SH3D5M"">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/5SH3D5M</a><br>thanks people",1
12242,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"True she shouldn&#39;t be there what she bring with her. Nothing?! She went on stage, talk sth about her. That it! Don&#39;t get me wrong she is cool smart ( sth odd about her but she could be ok. for everybody else) but this is TED!!! You expect extraordynary! This topic is common in self-deleopement and almost every were! YOU DON&#39;T NEED TO MAKE ANOTHER VID ABOUT IT!!",1
12243,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I was skeptical at first, but then I was pleasantly surprised by this woman&#39;s talk. She raised quite a few important issues and made some very important remarks and insightful comments. The talk was in short insightful, but towards the end it failed to send a proper message.",1
12244,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thank you for sharing the gift of YOU with the world, Goddess. Cameron you are brave and I value your authenticity. Thank you for telling the truth sister.",1
12245,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She sold her soul. If modelling wasn&#39;t her dream, she shouldn&#39;t have got into this. We all have to stop selling ourselves. We have one life to live our dreams. She just has been pushed into a business that doesn&#39;t please her at all.She might get old and feel sad for the rest of her life for not have worked what she wanted by heart...<br><br>When people say money doesn&#39;t buy happiness, they are really right.",1
12246,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beauty and how we perceive it has to do with the proportions and how they stack up to certain ratios.  Thats why some are perceived more beautiful than others.  Our brains automatically knows who is closer to the &quot;golden ratio&quot;  for mating reasons.  They say that woman&#39;s asses have gotten bigger through evolution as well as our best friend.,1
12247,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Us guys have always liked beautiful women since the dawn of time.  If we didn&#39;t there wouldn&#39;t be 8 billion people in the world.  Quit being sorry that your pretty.  So what there are many hot girls that I see just like you on a daily basis.  You didn&#39;t win any genetic lottery unless you dna is immune to all the multitude of diseases around the world as well as aging.<br>Your pretty I&#39;ll give you that but like someone once told me beauty is actually very common!,1
12248,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I guess the conclusion here is that TV is bad for you.,1
12249,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very eye opening and inspiring.  I now have a favorite model.,1
12250,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is awkward, lol.",1
12251,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you aren&#39;t good looking,you  get angry stare ",1
12252,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The amount of make up women wear today says a lot of out their insecurity ,1

It was incredible to sit around having lunch with girls while men literally flocked around our table because they were so beautiful, knowing they had these truly awful anxiety issues. It really took any jealousy I might have felt right out of me. Beauty is definitely not just a gift for women.",1
12254,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Am I the only one that got that the entire thesis of this speech was<br>&quot;It&#39;s unfortunate because I&#39;m the beneficiary of a racist and oppressive system....#YOLO &quot;  ???,1
12255,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I guess I missed something, but I got nothing out of this.",1
12256,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So, in other words....looks ARE everything, just if your good looking, you don&#39;t think you are, and a life of pampered luxury makes you unhappy? I wish I was a model.",1
12257,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah that&#39;s not how it works. It&#39;s not about winning a genetic lottery. There&#39;s unattractive white girls too. The reason why there&#39;s more white models is because there&#39;s more attractive white girls than black girls.,1
12258,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Most girls worry about how the look everyday. Not just models.,1
12259,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she seems fun to talk to, seems like she just scratched the surface with what she had to say.",1
12260,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,There goes away my model stereotype,1
12261,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,MY question is why would you choose to stay in an industry that promotes that?,1
12262,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Giggidy giggidy ,1
12263,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is interesting and she has some good points but I think it would be a lot more powerful for the young women she&#39;s talking to if it were entitled &quot;FORMER Model Tells Why She Left the Industry.&quot; She has a degree from Columbia-- modeling is not her only career option. If you want to talk &quot;brave&quot; then walk the walk and leave the industry you&#39;re criticizing behind. Otherwise, the message I get from this is money and fame are more important than sticking to you say you believe.",1
12264,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m going to look past the racism of this whole thing and acknowledge that she needs to stop saying &quot;um&quot; so much. It makes her seem unconfident.,1
12265,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what even was that. i have learnt absolutely nothing,1
12266,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In short, having white skin is beneficial and being black means your going to have daily challenges. In other news the sky is blue.",1
12267,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s true no one is more insecure then a model. Don&#39;t aim to be a product of the media. Aim to change it.,1
12268,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree. She is right. Believe me, I&#39;m a model too.",1
12269,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow that was impressive and inspiring!,1
12270,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Cameron I feel humbled by your honesty. Thank you for your openness.,1
12271,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, an impressive woman. The world could do with more people like her.",1
12272,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,the organization of this talk was all over the place. it was very unfocused so the payoff at the end was not as meaningful or informative as it could have been.,1
12273,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Sick of people promoting their goddamn twatter everywhere!,1
12274,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Oh my God this woman is a genius. I&#39;m legitimately in tears right now. ,1
12275,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"These are all interesting posts and conversations, and to be honest the notion of what constitutes as beauty has always intrigued me. As a young Hispanic female I can say that I know where I am placed in terms of beauty within my society. As Hispanic women are often deemed to be curvy and sexual but not nearly as beautiful as how the young white women are represented. I mean, this is just from my point of view, my place in beauty may be different to others. What I can&#39;t seem to understand is why are we as a society so fixated in being beautiful, having the perfect body, and face? I have researched that universal beauty is aliened with symmetry and the more symmetrical your face is the more beautiful it is. Sure, this may have some sound evidence because I believe we can all agree on some individuals whom may fit a universal attractiveness. However, I believe beauty is more than just a pretty face. Sometimes it cant be explained, and sometimes you may not notice someones beauty after a while of getting to know them. I feel as though media keeps trying to keep beauty within a box and brain wash us with physical traits that are desirable within certain ethic groups of people. However, this is where media messes up because it tends to chose models of different ethnic groups which more closely resembles that of white feature&#39;s or complexions. for example, in the media like spanish soap operas or westernized television, latina women are often tanned, have black long hair, with curvy bodys. Or sometimes they look white. However, media hardly recognizes latina women whom are black and whom have more Caribbean features. Imagine the message this sends to young latina women? I use latina women as an example from my experience, but I believe this is the same for many other ethnic groups as well.   ",1
12276,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,her nervous laugh is so fuckin annoying,1
12277,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love this talk! Also, love Cameron for being so honest. I know some people feel angry how models can sometimes get special treatment in real life, but at least she realises it&#39;s happening and doesn&#39;t really take it for granted.",1
12278,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Really fantastic talk.<br><br>@***** @TEDx  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23technology"">#technology</a>   <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23beauty"">#beauty</a>   <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23looks"">#looks</a>   <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23modeling"">#modeling</a> ",1
12279,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thumbs up if you&#39;re here for an analysis essay for your university.,1
12280,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"spellbinding standpoint!!, Cameron I am completely moved by your perspective on Beauty and Perception and how much we are obsessed with it. Most of things in life are superficial and yes We tend to get into appearance too much but the profoundness of reality is not it I tend to think so.",1
12281,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;On the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say, &#39;Look, I&#39;ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor.&#39; And it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with, &#39;And, it doesn&#39;t always make me happy.&#39; But mostly, it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries.&quot;",1
12282,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I just totally like this honest very personal talk. It takes so much guts to go out there and be honest. I am impressed.,1
12283,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This woman is making a really good point. It&#39;s good to see the truth being spoken,",1
12284,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i think there&#39;s a part of human subconscious that searches for certain physical traits when one is looking for a mate. i think i read somewhere that guys unknowingly search for women with traits that are similar to their mother.,1
12285,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,coment,1
12286,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,hi,1
12287,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,hi,1
12288,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,hi,1
12289,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Gorsh she&#39;s purty AND smart.. :3 LOL :p,1
12290,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Fascinating talk. It&#39;s not surprising that looks can get someone ahead in life, but that&#39;s only part of the equation of success. I found it refreshing that she said that models are the most insecure about themselves physically.",1
12291,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m often struck by the self-pity of very good looking people in the media. But I&#39;m impressed (and a bit charmed) by Cameron Russell until the bit at the end where she moans &quot;models are SOOO insecure about their looks&quot;. Easy to figure this one. If you rely on your looks for your income/living this is the inevitable result.,1
12292,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love that you say at <a href=""http://youtu.be/KM4Xe6Dlp0Y?t=6m55s"">6:55</a> that&#39;s all me.",1
12293,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am completely contrary to what this lady is saying.<br>She is wrong.<br>You are good looking because you are a good person inside and what you have outside is a reflection of that.<br>Ugly people are not good people and they were born ugly as a punishment for the things they did before they took physical form.<br>I trust a beautiful person ,man or woman a lot more than ugly ones.",1
12294,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If I was &quot;hot&quot; I&#39;d be embarrased to be a model... getting paid for basically not doing shit. Just standing still, LOL. &quot;Let the construction workers, engineers, artists, doctors, etc. let the real work, I will just smile and get the big bucks&quot;. What a fucking crazy world we have built. And to know that little kids look up to these kind of people, damn, that just crushes my idealism.",1
12295,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok so if you&#39;re complaining, you can easily stop being a model because they&#39;re a lot of girls/women that&#39;d want to be in your position right now. Stop taking it for granted.",1
12296,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I find it interesting, that while perusing the comments I noticed that most of the people hating on her are men.",1
12297,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I once read an essay on how models are selected based on their race. Each race has a different &quot;ideal&quot;: white women must be thin and tan with &quot;exotic&quot; features, like eyes and prominent cheekbones; Asian women must be small and doll-like with big, round eyes and cute faces; Latina women must be curvy and hypersexualized; black women must be curvy and sexualized as well and must be pale-skinned. So frivolous, dehumanizing, superficial, racist, and disgusting imo.",1
12298,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is intelligent and has insight. I&#39;ve found that many people internalize how they are treated based on their looks. People who are &quot;ugly&quot; or of a different body shape or non-white can develop a defensive or self-defeating attitude; pretty, young, white women either become reduced to their sexuality or feel entitled to better treatment. Bottom line, how someone looks should NOT determine who they are.",1
12299,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this is silly,1
12300,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great stuff, I just sent it to my daughter who&#39;s athletic prowess is on level with her looks. She is very competitive like me and much smarter too! I try and share with her the things that matter and I would like to thank Cameron for an insight a loving father could never convey. I am very excited to see her in college this Fall and take advantage of a well groomed path her brother has led her on.....he is graduating this year with his bachelors degree...",1
12301,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"My children&#39;s book is complete &quot;Amanda&#39;s Uncle Bob Eats, Drinks, &amp; Walks TOO Much?&quot; Commonly in our field we hear clients say their addiction started at ages 8 and 9, The DARE program starts @ age 11?<br>Thus my series &quot;Pre-Addictions Educational Series&quot; is to start this conversation about drugs, alcohol, overeating much earlier with children than age 11. (A common response that I receive is Uncle Bob walks too much? I call these &quot;white addictions&quot; they seem harmless on the surface but when some exercises to the point they&#39;re blowing their knees out or they&#39;re robbing their kids of &quot;one on one&quot; time there&#39;s a problem.

12302,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think content was good however I couldn&#39;t get past all the umps in your speech!,1
12303,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Guys you can&#39;t be pissed at her for being a model, the point of this video isn&#39;t fucking to suit your needs, it&#39;s amazing because she is under a lot of pressure and know she&#39;ll get some bad looks and knows that it&#39;s wrong and she&#39;s being honest. So many women, hell, men and women in any career wouldn&#39;t have he balls to take a stand like she did. She saying that models aren&#39;t perfect and everyone had flaws. Why the fuck should you be mad at her? She&#39;s not gonna stop modeling to fight for a cause that won&#39;t change if she stops.",1
12304,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Also shes in her mid twenties and i think she was 25 when she did this so yeah you look like a dumbass you just based your whole damn arguement around her being 30 and old when shes still young and pretty so yeah atleast take the 2 fucking seconds to google her age before you write a essay about how shes getting old and thats why shes giving out secrets.,1
12305,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Let me break down what was said in this video, she gets treated great and ugly people get treated bad but good looking people are insecure too. Wow i feel bad for good looking people now you really opened up my eyes to the truth. Let me support my statements with things she said. She said oh i get free stuff and i look good and i won the genetic lottery and non white people get pulled over and ugly people get treated bad. BUT WAIT here comes the bombshell! Shes insecure! So everyone feel bad for her and feel on equal level with her. Then tries to convice you shes not good looking and modling people just make her look good (which completely contradicts what she said rambling for 2 damn minutes about how she won the lottery of genes and how she gets free shit) so everyone in the audience feels like ugly people and good looking people are the same. Its honestly a dumb speech that contradicts itself at every turn.",1
12306,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the hateful comments are very sad. for anyone on here not completely blinded by their own arrogance, i urge you to ask yourself: do the people that you admire troll the internet in their free time? is that how they accomplished something more worthy of your time than this? ",1
12307,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Being unacceptable and separated from the beauty-icons the society admires and never get attention from boys but only offenses undoubtedly make you unhappy and insecure. Being insecure because you have to look nice all the time is not an excuse I think it is an exaggeration and you should be thankful of what nature gave you. As I said all those girls who cry themselves every day and every night since the society don not accept their appearance have a major reason to be insecure but not you. seriously not you. Just say thanks for your beauty. And also just because a stylish dresses you up and a photographer advices you how to pose doesn&#39;t vanish the fact that you have natural blue eyes, long healthy hair and so on... beauty is what it is.. believe me you do not calm those girls out there.. they already know the truth... !!",1
12308,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol honestly how many hot black girls have you seen in your daily life?,1
12309,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you liked this talked I would definitely recommend the documentary &quot;Picture Me&quot; on Netflix. More of an in depth look on some similar points, especially with the fashion industry.",1
12310,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is ridiculous! First, to everyone who are saying show should have gone to school. She went toColumbia University. Second, I don&#39;t think she was trying to enlighten you if you already know what she&#39;s talking about. She was trying to get the message to a wider audience who don&#39;t know. So I&#39;m sorry if you don&#39;t see the good in that.",1
12311,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"when I was a short, white, 14 year old boy, I said &quot;how can I be an nba star&quot;?",1
12312,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What an astonishing amount of self serving twaffle. Surprise, surprise, a rich, white model hits her 30&#39;s, gets slightly fewer gigs and for less money and then suddenly &quot;awakens to the truth&quot; of a shallow industry... what a shocker! She&#39;s no different than an aging stripper who can&#39;t get tips any more. She was utterly fine with the horribly classist system as long as she was at the top of it. It&#39;s only now that she&#39;s aging out of its incredibly narrow ideals that she wants to turn around and bite the hand that she didn&#39;t mind licking for as long as it was feeding her.<br><br>Pathetic hypocrite. Reminds me of a Hooters waitress who turned my IT manager down for a date, then hit on him three years later when she hit 35 and her hedge fund manager boyfriend broke up with her! It was only when her looks started to fade that the waitress conveniently realized how unimportant looks are... SOOO convenient, these insights!! I agree that women shouldn&#39;t be judged so harshly and shallowly, Cameron. So why don&#39;t you give ALLLLL of the money away that you made by being a part of that terrible system, THEN step back on stage to talk about how insightful you are and how damaging the very images that you helped to create are.<br><br>You disgust me.",1
12313,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Very good speech and all credit to Ms. Russell. The actual problem is that people buy into this at all. Can&#39;t blame the media and not ask why people read, watch and don&#39;t question or reject the message.",1
12314,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,im here for a fucking bullshit essay,1
12315,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Go skateboarding, Cameron - it makes everyone physically self confident",1
12316,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i have such mixed feelings about this talk. on the one hand i have such little respect for her for not being grateful for the lot she was given but with that said its nice to see that she understands that not everyone get&#39;s the same treatment.,1
12317,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,And finally. Without stating the painfully obvious: ck out the current FBI crime statistics please! <br>That truth will explain the &quot;real world&quot; of crime to this elite young woman....,1
12318,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"BTW,..she is not nearly as as hot as she thinks!Not as hot as some of the sexy,curvy Latina women I see everyday. This is a happily married white guy talking.<br>Seriously, Latinas have won like 4 of the last 5 Miss Universe beauty pageants!",1
12319,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"How cute. She has guilt for her looks and great career! And bet your ass she is still modeling.....that&#39;s ok! <br>I have no empathy for her,...its great to look fantastic. I don&#39;t. But I can still have a full life.<br>She just looks down on us uglies....she really would NEVER change lives or looks with less than avg looking people....<br>Not to worry! Time is cruel....have you seen a pic of Goldie Hawn lately?.....",1
12320,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Oh she&#39;s gooood.,1
12321,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I must say that I approached this talk with some scepticism. While I am not feeling totally enlightened at the end, still finding some flimsiness in the substance of the talk, I grew in admiration for this woman, because she seems very intelligent and articulate. The common idea being that intellect is not an abounding commodity in this environment, it was refreshing to see Cameron laying it all out so smartly,",1
12322,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,bet she new there would be alot of negative comments but she did it anyway good for her there is no denying racial profiling take from it what you will,1
12323,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She fails to realize that a good percentage of models only become models as a way to feel more secure and validate their worth.<br>There are plenty of prettier (even uglier) models who don&#39;t struggle with this inescapable sense of insecurity that you&#39;re conveying... no offense. not that you&#39;l ever read this Ms. Russell. &lt;3,1
12324,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Bitch you&#39;re insecure because you&#39;re insecure... the fact that you&#39;re a successful underwear model who&#39;s insecure speaks volumes about your balance.<br>I still value the speech tho, thanks.",1
12325,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,An honest one!,1
12326,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,oh and fuck media,1
12327,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Girls can be anything? Anything that doesn&#39;t pay you more than minimum wage leads to student loan debt. What, other then selling sex, modeling, are the men who are in control of the economy willing to pay women for? Clearly not for going to school. In that we are equal; we are required to get into massive debt in spite of the fact that our job opportunities are fewer. There is nothing a woman who is born with nothing can do without the convenience of having rich parents that will pay them enough to pay for college, other than selling sex. Otherwise, fast forward to graduation and six figures in student loans. Can&#39;t afford to get a first job because those unforgivable student loan payments are higher than your rent. No man wants to marry you because no man wants to marry your debt. The number of women who pull themselves out of poverty though education is too small to call it a rule. Include the debt factor and women will slave themselves though college into a lifetime of debt slavery to student loans. Then they will look around for someone to care that they are poorer than before they went to college in the first place and they will find NOBODY. For a woman, poverty + education = destitution; it is a tragic fact than nobody in this country will acknowledge much less care about or do anything about. It is one thing to cash in on being a model and tell other girls that they can get an education. You can fly to the moon when you have money in your bank account. It is quite another to actually get an education on a minimum wage and a job afterward (and in an ever dwindling job market in case nobody has bothered to notice). Women who are &quot;successful&quot; in this society either had rich parents, married money or worked as strippers, prostitutes or super models  or are one of a tiny number of TOKEN women who have been chosen as &quot;an example,&quot; to lead all of the others to hopeless dreaming like a carrot before the horse. Things have not changed much since Wollstonecraft wrote her Vindication. Women are as ever STILL dependent on the graces of men and men do not like women to be independent. If they did there would be widely accessible avenues for women to raise themselves up without selling sex in one form or another.",1
12328,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,PRETTY HURTS<br>SHINE A LIGHT ON WHATEVER&#39;S WORSE,1
12329,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Can I be in the show I have a story myself,1
12330,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I can&#39;t believe some of you guys missed what she said in the video. You can&#39;t call her a hypocrite for not wanting young girls to pursue modeling when they can be so much more. She dreamed for this when she was young, she thought it would be everything she ever wanted. According to her modeling had it&#39;s perks but it didn&#39;t make her happy most of the time. Didn&#39;t you hear that part about the rsum? She&#39;s saying she could&#39;ve quit this modeling industry that contributes to a discriminating society but when people look at your rsum and see you&#39;ve been an underwear model for 10 years..what would they think right? Also, right now this is what she&#39;s good at. If she ever did want to pursue anything else, would she even have the qualifications for that after spending ten years modeling?",1
12331,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You can tell she was so nervous. Glad she pulled through alright, what an interesting glimpse behind the scenes.",1
12332,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This video was as superficial and utterly pointless as the speaker. Complete. Waste. Of time.,1
12333,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Blow it out your ass!!!!,1
12334,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s not a form of oppression that most models are white skinned women, white women just tend to be more beautiful, or a majority of people in America would think so.",1

12337,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Myth Myth Myth, Black and dark cloored women are absolutely beautiful. ",1
12338,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good show, but goes on a little too long. Better if she actually had some more ideas to combat the whole media, rather than saying something a lot of people knew. It was good to hear an actual model ridicule the hell out of it. Reminds me of Jennifer Lawrence who slams the whole Hollywood thing. Still, a lot of great personality and fun nonetheless.",1
12339,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It is so sad to see people being so judgmental to this woman. Give the lady a break. She is not trying to say that her life is awful because of her profession, she asking for us to not judge others on their appearances. ",1

12341,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, I&#39;m saddned by all the cruelty and judgments I read in a lot of comments. Just because there are other issues in the world, i.e. starvation and war, does not mean the issue she is talking about is irrelevant.  Putting yourself out there as vulnerable and sharing personal experiences is difficult for almost anyone.  Why do some people constantly seek to invalidate the feelings of others just because their life seems easier?  You may not like it but what she is saying is true.",1

For the better or worse, by either hitting up the gym or hitting up the meth (for a crude example).<br>2.: Beauty standards aren&#39;t a conspiracy against people who don&#39;t live up to them, they&#39;re<br>just preferences of the general population of a culture.<br>In India, the standard is a pretty Indian girl, in Japan a Japanese girl, etc. ...<br>3.: Modelling has no demands except good genes, but for some unrelated reason it makes her feel pressured to maintain great looks?<br>Maybe THAT are the job demands...? (see point 1)",1
12346,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Challenging talk to listen to. On the one hand she embodies thin privilege, white privilege and has her success through a racist, sexist and aesthetically based system, but on the other hand she is acknowledging her privilege and really wrestling with making a living out of this system that has benefited her and screwed others, and acknowledging that her image is created. I liked her though! And to all you knobs in the comments open your minds a little bit and see the bigger picture. She doesn&#39;t have to have the answers to fix a broken society, but what&#39;s amazing is seeing her ask the questions.",1
12347,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What she says is : good looks, and the best things in life won&#39;t guarantee you happiness. It&#39;s all temporary. So move past these false ideas of happiness out there and find your own. ",1
12348,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i dont understand why so many people get upset for her talk and call her a hypocrite, shes not saying that shes the most sad persona in the world, shes just telling the truth and you criticize her for that... Who is the really hypocrite here? How many people can be open like her about the ugly things about you profession? ",1

12366,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think the most important message was delivered in those 10 seconds she spent changing her outfit. It really did convey the &quot;I can change what you think of me only with the way I look&quot; message. I think it was a great way to start the talk.,1

12368,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She feels like she has to apologize to women for being beautiful, which is playing into the conscious or subconscious agendas of women. Women like to shame their more beautiful rivals into hiding or reducing their beauty because that in turn increases their own sexual market value.

I suggest you keep building your argument there. That is something I would like to hear. Because you struggle in trying to define what exactly makes a women attractive, at least in the eyes of a straight man. Do you really think our eyes are so stupid and foolish to be lead on by a predetermined social deck? Are we that dumb to you? You talk about being tall, but I guarantee you we are just as attracted to short attractive women as we are tall attractive women. Height is, if anything, a deck your modeling industry created.<br>Cameron, you may be interested in directing some of your studies into evolutionary psychology to find an answer, or  a little bit of research into golden ratio proportions could go a long way . as it defines beauty without any consideration to race or skin color. And you may be oh so surprised to find out that you and all of your pretty modeling friends have faces that fall into golden ratio proportion molds . All a coincidence I supposed? . Not too much forehead, not too little . Not too much lip, not too little . A delicate balance in-between . Verified by just about everything you find in NATURE. Hardly a deck that people created and you should know, its very difficult to argue against nature.<br><br>All the dudes below who are somewhat outside of golden ratio proportions fawning and trying to get closer to Cameron .

Could it be she actually believes she is presenting a novel point of view and really wants to see a day whena traffic coptreats her like anyone else,or stores turn her away for not having money?

(I know you look at my pic and think I dont see it. I am 35 now, it was ten years ago) The lesson you are taught over and over again is, you are only worth what your beauty will give you. A 100 lbs weight gain later and you find out that the modeling (no matter how long or short you work in that field) will mess with your mind. I am smart, a mother of three, college educated, but the biggest issue with my weight gain wasn&#39;t my health, it was my face, and how I hated looking at pictures of myself during that time.

It drains everything about you that individualises you and replaces it with mutable substances that can change depending on who is watching to sate their need or want for something to look up to or aspire to.<br><br>As a model you are working to increase global depression and teenage suicides. You are effectively becoming a weapon for the industries concerned with such to destabilise their consumers to ensure rising profits. You want this life because it promises glory, fame, fortune and recognition, just like some people want the Big Mac on the picture because it promises to make your mouth euphoric. It&#39;s escapism for you and poison for everyone touched by your success.<br><br>It&#39;s another example in the line of examples that human beings are manipulated into buying things, ideas and dreams they neither want or need. It is no coincidence that our western culture perpetuates consumption beyond anything, regardless of the fact that consumption is almost proportionately rising with depression and anxiety.<br><br>The solution lies in stepping out of your heels. Letting your hair go. Smiling regardless of whether you had braces or not. Laughing like your tonsils are the most beautiful thing on you. It requires some spine to do this, because you will upset your peers. The group of people surrounding you because you made it your goal in life to move yourself as far away from yourself as a child as possible.

We did not construct the need for beauty anymore than an animal construct the need to find a good looking mate and yes animals do that a lot.There is a profound meaning in the search for beauty and that search can have many different manifestation.<br><br>At least as a man I can say that the vast majority of guys out there they wont stay in a relationship tolerating a bad personality for great looks.

I could see the effect her external looks had on people and besides some very nice compliments pretty much that was it. It was not as big deal as people make it. She was never treated as a goddess and she taught us not to put much notice on looks alone. <br><br>And is not even hard to find good looking women or good looking men. So in the end I would say &quot;Its not as a big deal as you think, get over it!&quot;<br><br>And most people that are really ugly usually is because they dont take care themselves. Personally I prefer a woman with the wrong genes that takes care of herself and she has a good personality over a woman with excellent genes that does not take care of herself and has also a good personality.<br><br>Experience also taught me that people not taking care their looks , they tend not to take care their personality too. Though the opposite certainly is not as true as I would want it to be.",1
12445,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron pretty much says it...<br><br>Who the heck would want to be a model? A career of petty insecurity where you get told what to do and how to do it. It&#39;s a career of zero personal respect, only shallow admiration.<br>The only reason to be a model is because, if you won the genetic lottery like Cameron, it&#39;s easy money and easy fame. Cameron, at least, knows how to use her looks for success, and use that success to earn some genuine respect.<br><br>And image is indeed important. Think about a job interview, or approaching a stranger in public, or trying to get a date... these mere social events can potentially change your entire life: a career, a friend, a spouse and family. And they depend on image.",1

12450,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,here&#39;s what I get from this video: some people get lucky with their genetics to naturally have good looks and height. some aren&#39;t. atleast she seeeems humble about it.....I guess,1
12451,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Statistics dont lie,1
12452,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"so real....n so honest. i like her, guess al models arent dumb",1
12453,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Interesting that she never uses the word &quot;job&quot;. After all modelling is a job , she&#39;s paid to be a saleswoman , using imagery to sell people products.",1
12454,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I liked the beginning but I wish she went into more detail about why models are the &quot;most physically insecure people on the planet.&quot; The speech should have gone on for longer. In one aspect, she is telling us how beauty isn&#39;t everything but I feel like she is also delivering the message that we should sympathise with models - something that most people would feel offended by; especially considering how they chose this career themselves...",1
12455,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is amazing,1
12456,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I thought there would be some revelation for me at the end of this video. Nope, just a model confirming what I already knew.",1

12460,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron, you may have won the &quot;genetic lottery&quot;,but you have clearly worked hard to educate yourself and construct an amazing and powerful perspective that I believe has the potential to change lives. To have what most would consider as an &quot;easy run&quot;, yet committing yourself to personal improvement and validation is ore inspiring!! I often watch TED talks and loved to be inspired, but your talk is the only one in years of viewing that I have felt compelled to comment on. Thank you.",1
12461,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, the comparison between the magazine photo and the picture of her with her grandma...they made her look like a 20-something year old sex symbol when she&#39;s only just a girl.",1
12462,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow..  I think her msg only spans to women..    if i wer a male model i would so MILK ITTTT!!!!  regardless of my insecurity or feelings..,1
12463,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"good for her, this is interesting",1
12464,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Her statement &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; is actually spot on. Yes, good-looking people get further than the average person but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re eternally happy. It&#39;s what&#39;s on the inside that counts in the long term, not what&#39;s on the outside. Character isn&#39;t built on the outside, rather it&#39;s on the inside. The nicest people in the world don&#39;t have a stereotypical appearance, because they&#39;re the ones unwilling to be superficially judged.",1
12465,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,bravo,1
12466,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I as well don&#39;t think she succeeded in sending the message across. She is insecure.. So? Like one of the comments bellow said, 99% procent of people are, except most of them don&#39;t have their looks to help them and they have to fight with what they have. And these things are taken away from them everyday by repression, in all senses. She warned about it, but that is all. Still better than nothing, I suppose. More people should warn about it, and start thinking in ways to fix this.",1
12467,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you!,1
12468,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,these comments are disturbing. did they listen to her speech at all?,1
12469,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It was HONEST talk... many facts disclosed that we all know and calling it racists and discrimination...ample Law and Human Rights Offices in Canada are appointed to enforce Civil rights...but all Judges, lawyers and Police Officers are the WORST FASCISTS and corupt in the earth!!!",1
12470,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There are some very good things in this video. It is good to shed light on some of the problems in society that are occurring; but i do not completely agree with her outlook on life. She said she is a model but that is not who she is but only her profession. What she fails to understand is that, what you do every day for work AND what you do outside of work IS who you are. Every single decision you make in life is a part of WHO or WHAT you are as a person. The world has many different effects on a person and people cannot always control their situations or surroundings but anytime people are given a choice they become more of themselves. Who you were yesterday and who you are today can be different people also. If you choose to go to work every day and be a model, YOU ARE A MODEL. I&#39;m not saying that is a good or bad thing. She seems like a pretty kind and caring model :) but that is still a part of who she is in my opinion. :)",1
12471,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel I have to call this girl out - the very idea of modeling indicates there is an idealized human form and therefore any that don&#39;t adhere to it are thus less human.<br>considering this is 99% of the populationher actions are therefore morally unjustifiable and mean..... Part of the problem not the solution...Something...Something....Etc...,1
12472,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Did a good job; thank you Cameron. ~~~Nancy Koncilja Gurish,1
12473,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"first, she is not that hot, I think saying she won the genetic lottery is going too far, and finally looks do matter but as long as you&#39;re OK-looking, you&#39;re relatively smart and you make decent money you&#39;re gonna be a good catch.",1
12474,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i feel like a lot of people is missing the point bc she didn&#39;t say that looks don&#39;t matter, she said its NOT everything. and a lot of people are &#39;hating&#39; on her since she&#39;s a model she can&#39;t say that. and which, in my opinion, her being a model makes it more meaningful as models are supposed to be pretty and have good looks.",1
12475,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Looks arent everything&quot;.... says the model, probably size 0, who says &quot;If some of the women were horrified when I came out.&quot; go fuck yourself. That was such a backhanded comment to make that I don&#39;t think anyone else understood. Everything she said after that had absolutely no effect on me. She&#39;s also a horrible speaker...<br>and it&#39;s really sad that this is what it comes down to.",1
12476,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If only a model could give a powerful speech. She talked for 11 mins(dont quote me) but she didn&#39;t really say much. I have so much more I want to know about her. It&#39;s interesting that she gave a ted talk,1
12477,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she is an awful speaker,1
12478,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not that this talk even touched on the title, but even if it had. Sorry, but models don&#39;t get to say that looks aren&#39;t everything. They have no idea because they have looks. &quot;Believe me, I&#39;m a model&quot;? That is exactly why your opinion on the affirmative has absolutely no bearing. The same way that superstars like Kelly Clarkson go on about how young women shouldln&#39;t worry about working to stay thin, everything worked out for her right? It is complete lunacy. She forget to add the part about being sure to be a mega millionaire superstar. I&#39;m not saying you have to aim for model looks, but don&#39;t think you are going to attract the guys you want to be with listening to the Oprahs and Clarkson&#39;s of the world. They don&#39;t live in the real world. Looks matter.",1

Also, I can&#39;t stop asking myself why on Earth she doesn&#39;t use all that power she possesses (men understand what I&#39;m talking about) to do greater things instead of bitching about it? She has so much power and she&#39;s giving it all away, while she could be making millions just doing nothing and then, for example, giving that money to the poor...but no! she wants to be a rocket scientist, jesus...maybe she is doing just that, maybe I&#39;m just ignorant.

12482,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s a little disturbing how even TED talks tend to chronically keep under representing minority &amp; colored women. Progressive policy is to give a voice to the underprivileged. Yet, the very women in society who still suffer the most from pressure of conservatism &amp; the religious right, and who lack upward mobility and financial independence most often, are time &amp; again being sidelined in favor of upper middle class white women.<br><br>In the year 2013, something about this mentality is becoming very worrying.",1
12483,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is so incredibly true,1
12484,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I enjoyed her talk. She is a beautiful woman with a heart and a brain. She graduated from Columbia University,1
12485,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She should&#39;ve started talking to the audience as an average person, with skirt + top etc and then in the final 5 minutes stripped to the outfit she had in the beginning of this video and told everyone that she was a model. That to me would&#39;ve made a much bigger impact.",1
12486,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Damn. She was showing off dat body tho,1
12487,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Anyone else find that she got more and more attractive as the talk went on?,1
12488,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Guess this is that &quot;fucking art&quot; everyone around are talking about,1
12489,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this was very needed-- i wish people in her business were more forthcoming about the truth- of these constructions- but it would hurt the business. THANK YOU CAMERON. You will help many people to get free from these falicies, because of ur contribution, including me. This truth is something I often suspected, thank u for confirming it.",1
12490,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,All of you ugly people should be grateful !!,1
12491,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The point is that public images are a construction , they are fiction, but somehow are leading our societys standards and this should not be happening. She pointed out her beeing beautiful was a matter of luck, wich kinda is, and that we shouldnt get carried on by these ideas of beauty created by a few people. Shes making an invitation to all of us to free our minds of the concept of &quot;beauty&quot; public imagery has created for the last 200 years for us to realize that beauty can be found anywhere.",1
12492,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Of course looks aren&#39;t eveything, MONEY is everything. Cold hard truth.",1
12493,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I understand the point, but I felt like this was only half of what she wanted to say.<br>&quot;It&#39;s not me.&quot; But she never explained who she thought she was.",1
12494,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow. If there is a perfect woman, this is it. So humble and smart and well spoken and honest and naturally beautiful.",1
12495,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not very interesting,1
12496,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think that she made a point that she didn&#39;t even realize that she was making. Looks and presentation are important. ANY human being on this planet can take the time to groom themselves, find a pleasing outfit and look much better than had they not spent the time and effort. In addition, why are 83% of new york stop and frisks conducted on non-whites? I contend decades of criminal behavior being associated with how they carry themselves, dress themselves and groom themselves. My guess would be a much lower percentage of actual racism than anyone wants to talk about these day. If we did talk about it, there would be a destruction of the victim narrative.",1
12497,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Perhaps she is a bit nervous. But that didn&#39;t stop me from hearing a message that was made very simple and clear for me... Modelling is a construction. Looks have got her a career, they have got her free things, she is treated better BUT she is not less insecure than everyone else. She is not that fearless person on the magazine cover, she is just someone who won the genetic lottery who was constructed further to look like that! And with this, she is also making the point that models aren&#39;t heard because of their dishonesty and often seen as superficial... which is what she is proving at the beginning. I liked it, I thought it was brave.",1
12498,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Kind of ironic though that the only reason she is standing their giving her talk is because of her looks. Anyway, very bad title; it doesn&#39;t really represent what she argues. Really it should be &#39;Looks shouldn&#39;t matter&#39;.<br>The title is like saying &#39;being white isn&#39;t everything&#39;, being white gives one amazing amount of advantage but at the same time other races may hate you and judge for your privileges, when really race shouldn&#39;t matter. So the alternative title to this scenario should be &#39;race shouldn&#39;t matter&#39;.<br>Which is what I feel like she was trying to get across, that we shouldn&#39;t be judging people by their exterior appearance as a method of judging one&#39;s ability. And in the same way stereotypes of race are reinforced through media and public opinion so are looks.",1
12499,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fuck the superficial girls,1
12500,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,amazing,1

12502,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Better looking people are more successful in life, that is a fact.",1
12503,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A lot of people think that her opinion is invalid because she is pretty, therefore she doesn&#39;t understand the other end of the spectrum. However if that is true doesn&#39;t that mean that the vice versa is also true? You guys don&#39;t know how it feels to be oggled by men everywhere you go when you just want to go eat a bagel. You also don&#39;t know how it must feel to be noticed and hated by people who are &quot;less fortunate&quot; than you are, it would make me feel like it was my fault. When I was kid I was kinda of chubby, had very little friends, had a jew fro, and poor grades I was not happy because of those things, but I was happy because I was myself and nobody cared to tell me otherwise, I was artistic and imaginative. Now I&#39;m 19 very attractive (due to facial structure) athletic(high metabolism kicked in as well as natural muscle growth) successful in college (that I&#39;ll admit was hard work) and I am happy about that but I now have a constant sense of inadequacy like I could still do better also now people pay attention to me and they judge me, ALWAYS. None of my genetic gifts console me of that fact. In fact the stigma&#39;s in our society that surround superficial beauty make it so that when someone like my girlfriend Says,&quot; you&#39;re pretty&quot; I take it as either &quot;Oh he looks like shit today let me cheer him up&quot; Or &quot;You&#39;re pretty stupid but it&#39;s ok because you&#39;re pretty&quot; contradictory statements and yet that is what goes through my mind all the time and I believe both of them at times. I&#39;ll admit some of her facts were a little random but I think it is very interesting to hear someone who is &quot;beautiful&quot; to talk about how it really is.",1
12504,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is making an amazingly simple point that a lot of young girls may not yet realize. And as these young girls age, hopefully they will understand that even if they were given a perfect life full of money, looks, and a happy family, there will still be some type of challenge that they have to deal with. I thought Cameron&#39;s presentation was spot on and courageous as she exposed herself for everyone to judge (and learn from).

12507,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Interesting talk; to the extent that many people do hold those beliefs.<br><br>But to quote Kanye West &quot;Money isn&#39;t everything, but not having it is&quot;<br><br>And to that Cameron Russell&#39;s insight hopefully will provide solace to those who do not have the genetic deck.<br><br>But so long as one participates in the paradigm and profits from it, then their words will always have a limited value.<br><br>To the extent that she is rising awareness, kudos.",1
12508,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t understand why some people commenting are being so critical. That this talk is not &quot;well delivered&quot; or she is &quot;out of breath&quot; or there should be more &quot;depth&quot;. She explained that she was nervous to get up here and she still did it. I truly appreciate her bravery and I think she explained herself in the best way that SHE could. I don&#39;t need her to be Obama to get her point across, like some of you apparently expect from her. That&#39;s not who she is. Those judgmental attitudes are the same attitudes apparent in the industry of image. Expecting people to be something other than themselves. Why don&#39;t you guys get up and give a ten minute talk that is going to be seen by the world and tell me how nervous you would be. She could just ignore the truth of her career and keep taking advantage, but the fact that she has taken the time to speak out and acknowledge that her career is essentially luck and false imaging is commendable. That can change some perspectives, especially those of young girls trying to emulate her and other &quot;sexy girls&quot;.",1

12510,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I haven&#39;t read all the comments, but quite a few and it seems many or most miss a vital message in the talk. Perhaps we take it for granted or maybe it&#39;s so rare these days that we don&#39;t notice when it&#39;s in our face. Cameron&#39;s empathy and compassion are breathtaking. This is what I take away and I thank her for enriching my life.",1

The way you frame a particular statistic affects one&#39;s understanding of it as much as changing your clothes affects how people gauge your mood.",1
12516,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this talk is really just okay. she is not giving any substantial points on self-love. most people in the modeling industry are insecure, therefore looks aren&#39;t everything. ok what about girls who are not models? they are pretty insecure too. i was expecting to hear something more in depth.",1

12520,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So a beautiful woman talks about the fashion industry in a highly self-aware and reflected way and instead of recognising how this defies the clich that models have to be dumb, people attack her for talking about these things while being beautiful, something that she herself commented made her an unlikely person to bring it up.<br><br>By that logic, no white person can ever try and raise awareness about racism, nobody with an actual voice can talk about the marginalised. That&#39;s stupid!

This woman was even factually wrong when she said that tall, slim figures have been considered beautiful for centuries. This is actually a legacy of the postwar world, where capitalism put a dollar-value on physical attractiveness and hence created an industry (see 17th, 18th and 19th art regarding the female form).<br>The importance of image is not going to change in the near future (or ever), so this talk was a purposeless waste of time.

12544,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very interesting. I have a friend who is a famous model (won&#39;t say who); she has been transitioning into another creative endeavor for a few years now. She once told me &quot;They pay me a ridiculous amount of money for what I do&quot; and said it with an odd blend of acceptance and dismissive-ness. I am glad for her that she is exploring her other passions.<br>Kudos to Cameron for having the courage to create and go through with this talk.,1
12545,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There&#39;s a lot more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking.",1
12546,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Absolute BS. It is the fact that she is a RICH white woman who did nothing except feed off her mom&#39;s success. I have seen tons of white women who are just as gorgeous but poor; consequently they are not famous. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s going to choose a future boyfriend/husband that will be ugly.....give me a break.,1

I honestly think most people are at least decent looking when they put in the effort just like how Cameron looks more attractive in the model poses. I do think physical attractiveness is partly constructed like she said, for example white skin is considered pretty she says. But I have seen attractive people from all races, I kind of associate attractiveness more with hygiene and health though maybe that&#39;s why I believe most people can look decent when they try to.",1
12552,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Your entire life you are judged by how you look.  From the very first minute someone lays eyes on you they judge you firstly by your appearance.  What this women said in her talk was inspiring but it also reminded me how cruel human beings can be.  You will always have it easier if you are better looking this is the truth.  You can work really hard and still achieve a lot.  But unless you are pretty and right kind of pretty your life will be a lot harder.  Usually it&#39;s only the plain people who point out the flaws in our appearance driven culture because it hinders them in some way or another.  I applaud someone who is benefiting from this messed up culture to point out its flaws and say that it&#39;s wrong when it would be much easier for her to sit back enjoy all the perks of being pretty.   ,1

That&#39;s why you need looks to succeed as an actor or actress.",1
12555,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So she&#39;s kinda smart too be a model. But that&#39;s just like being kind of smart to be a republican. The whole concept of being a model is still bullshit. Even if all that make up and airbrushing is something they would call &quot;art&quot;, it&#39;s still not the kind of art that teaches us something important. You&#39;re just a live mannequin, not an actress.<br>You&#39;re just selling crap we don&#39;t need.<br>And since she has realized that her work has contributed to people feeling insecure, why is she still a model?",1

And you seem to be implying that because someone is beautiful and therefore has an advantage in life, that means they&#39;re beauty-stemmed anxieties are going to be insignificant. I mean I don&#39;t know but if you look at the lives of a lot of models I&#39;d say they&#39;re not happy lives.

Secondly &quot;We already know the role looks play in society&quot;. Well done I&#39;m glad you fully understand this complex issue.

Thirdly &quot;It&#39;s biological, behavioral, and inelastic&quot;. What do you mean by it&#39;s behavioral? I presume by it&#39;s inelastic you mean it doesn&#39;t change. This is clearly wrong, as indeed she implies in this talk.

12573,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. I think she really reinforced the point that looks aren&#39;t everything, they only seem that way to people living in the materialist bubble, who ironically, despite having a higher standard of living than the majority of the world, remain some of the unhappiest people alive. The truth is looks really don&#39;t matter, because what all humans really care about is being loved, that&#39;s where obsession with looks really stem from,that if I&#39;m not good looking people won&#39;t accept me",1

These people are viewed positively and are probably happy/confident.  But others are portrayed as ppl of sex. Its degrading and points out everyone else&#39;s flaws (mocking the &quot;ugly&quot; women) to sell a product.

Luckily the majority of us are born with a brain that can be trained to be good at almost every intellectual endeavour, if we stimulate it the right way (socially, educationally, physically, etc.).

12672,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You women looking at this model in awe seriously need to work on your thought processes.  This &quot;talk&quot; is not automatically inspiring because she admitted she&#39;s benefited from what the world perceives as beautiful - it&#39;s called common sense.  These TED talks have really dropped off in quality.  They used to make you think and challenged your beliefs.  Cameron didn&#39;t do that - at all.

12674,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,it&#39;s useless because she essentially said she&#39;s aware she got lucky and we should be aware of it too.  That&#39;s the gist of her entire little talk.  She also made an incorrect assumption that it&#39;s the skin color that affects latino or black population whereas it&#39;s the money issue.  She didn&#39;t bother to check the stats on people of color in the suburbs where there is more wealth.  Why exactly should I applaud a talk based on an idiot misunderstanding the situation?

I&#39;ve read elsewhere that she is a Bill Clinton fan, perhaps this is really a political speech?  Maybe she wants some kind of affirmative action or racial quotas when it comes to beauty.  Maybe she prefers that people like ugly over beauty, and that it will some way render her equal to an ugly violent screaming black kid with a long criminal record?",1

Few people may find you still good looking and few people might not have found you good looking 20 years ago. Why do you expect all white people to be rich? Also, you might be poor in your country but if you dissolve your assets and take money to a county with economy not developed as your country then you are not necessarily poor.",1

12761,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think the point here is not her lack of gratitude. She is trying to make a point here that looks are not everything which is great coming from a model who makes her living based on her looks. I think she just wasn&#39;t able to put the &quot;punch&quot; into the talk to make it as interesting as you would expect a TED talk to be. And she did seem self-conscious and intimidated on stage.,1
12762,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow, what an awesome lady - so much respect!",1
12763,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,money rules..simple,1
12764,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,look it up instead of being ignorant.,1
12765,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t think so. What makes you say that?,1
12766,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You just contradicted yourself....,1
12767,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Who buy those clothes? If pale people hire pale models for pale people then how is that universal beauty? Besides models are treated as hangers and are static. Beauty is not boring and static. Beauty is energy and action. I&#39;m sure to you blondes are beautiful. Well, I&#39;m talking about human beauty and not ghosts. You may find girls who sell clothes attractive, that does not mean everyone else finds them attractive. Your view is not world view, wake up and open your eyes.",1
12768,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"true. but she is talking about a girls choice of a career and how they view them selves, politics is a side issue.",1
12769,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,great young bright lady.,1
12770,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"man i love ted talks, this chick knows what shes talking about. hell yeah.",1
12771,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Interesting highlight, not really anything new though.",1
12772,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The people that hire the models don&#39;t hire their own personal preference. They hire girls that sell cloths. The girls that sell cloths are the ones that on average are found to be the most attractive and that is PALE etc. Us common sense not politically correct idealism,1
12773,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Isn&#39;t it sad when a woman that has the insight of the average YouTube commenter gets to talk at TED just because she is a model and everyone claps not expecting anything above an IQ of 60 (functionally retarded),1
12774,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,stop looking and listen what she is saying.,1
12775,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,good looking people get the most benefits in all avenues of life.,1
12776,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Everyone wants to think that they are beautiful and it is essential to boost their self-confidence. Anybody can look clean and neat with high maintenance and make-up, but there are only few type of girls who look naturally beautiful.
Because few pale guys with money hired pale girls does not mean that everybody thinks pale girls are beautiful.Few pale people and people who are blinded by media/make-up finds pale girls beautiful
To me Indians and Latinas are the most gorgeous women on this planet",1
12777,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great Ted talk,1
12778,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"BRAVE BRAVE BRAVE
",1
12779,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks are everything that you can buy. Not what really matters.,1
12780,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thank you for saying that and i completely agree! And honestly she looks like eva mendes who is latina and has a darker skin tone half the time. ,1
12781,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,who says it is more beautiful. it clearly is not esp asians come on now ,1
12782,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,And that they offer you so many opportunities that you wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. So how shitty do you think people feel in they don&#39;t get these opportunities. I know it affects my self esteem. ,1
12783,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Love your speech, well done!",1
12784,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think she&#39;s being honest not condescending at all ,1
12785,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What problem?  She&#39;s talking about her life as a model.  ,1
12786,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"WTF, she&#39;s basically saying looks are everything",1
12787,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,And there&#39;s exactly the problem she&#39;s referring to.,1
12788,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree with you but those extra perks should not be inherited, they should be earned.",1
12789,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You&#39;re*,1
12790,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,One of the worst TED talks ever. She is beautiful but her speech was shitty.,1
12791,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Women get to creep shame all they want, so dont tell us we cant rejector shame you.",1
12792,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ladies, - I&#39;m a straight guy but unfortunately there are a lot of men out there who give those of us who are genuinely interested in your personality a bad name because of the way you get treated. No wonder a lot of us are still single and that it&#39;s difficult for men and women to get together when a lot of guys act like morons and women understandably treat the rest of us with suspicion right from the start. Your looks may make you pretty, but it&#39;s your heart and soul that make you beautiful.",1
12793,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This bitch is smoking HOT!,1
12794,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I just realized shes anorexic :/ that is my issue with the fashion industry,1
12795,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes but the question remains, why do you women have to do all the judging?

Do you seriously think that men don&#39;t want to be approached and impressed and picked up by women every now and then?

This is 2013 and guys still have to do all the impressing, pickups, asking out while you women just sit on your asses, judge and determine if your into him all the time.

Why can&#39;t it be 50/50.

Believe me missy, No guy has a 100% rate. if you were a guy you would see why we think women can be shallow.smh",1
12796,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lol trust me Looks are extremley important.
If a good looking person came up to you and and showed interest in you then you would pay more attention to him as opposed to a ugly person.
Personality comes AFTER the introduction and the introduction is more effective if you look good.",1
12797,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,which is the proper way to start the conversation then with someone you dont know yet? judging someone by the first sentence they say to you seems pretty superficial to me. You will not know their character by their opening line and by rejecting them immediatly you say you dont care about it either... Dont pretend like looks dont matter to women. ,1
12798,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Obviously you have not read the work of Thomas Sowell, Charles Murray or Phil Rushton. 
I&#39;m afraid that much of intelligence and behavior traits ARE genetic in origin. 
And, no, not every human has capacity for them. You won&#39;t run the 100 yd in world record time. You were not born with that speed due to genetics. ",1
12799,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Almost thought that she was going to talk about some very in-depth issues and use some intelligence to make a point...but, sadly, she did not :(",1
12800,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beautiful Soldier - It took real guts to walk onto one of the most widely respected stages in the world and open your heart like that. You were warm, inviting, charming, and obviously of superior intellect as demonstrated by the deep meaning and expert manner you chose to deliver your message. A true beautiful soldier - aka: artist. Rock on white girl! lol Enjoy MFJLabs 5x",1
12801,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"For one thing, I have to assume that humanity, though possibly unaware of it, is giving preference to beautiful people in an attempt to increase the overall beauty of the human population. That could be at least partly true and obviously it is a very complex set of factors that determine what humanity is &quot;attempting&quot; to do with itself. Don&#39;t feel guilty about what you have gotten from a legacy, consider what you decide to propagate. What are you responsible for and how do you treat people?",1
12802,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Those things are largely shaped by genetics and environments that people barely have chance to choose for their own. It sucks but true.,1
12803,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what the fuck this bitch talking bout,1
12804,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well, it&#39;s okay to say &quot;Your eyes are pretty&quot; But when they GRAB you or whistle or say some douchebag line, I am 100% sure a woman won&#39;t be going on a date with them. I think that if they compliment you, you should say thanks. But if you talk to them and the only thing they&#39;re interested in is looks, chances are they&#39;re an asshole.",1
12805,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is brilliant . It&#39;s great that she opened up .,1
12806,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It takes a lot of courage to be open and honest like that. Much respect.,1
12807,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I find it rather stupid  to feel guilty about it though.
In a country built by white people you would expect white people to have a few extra perks.",1
12808,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yep, looks will get you a pass in life, but its not only looks, intelligence/hardwork/determination are all traits&#39; that are genetically passed on and you can say that those kinds of people also get a &quot;free pass&quot; in life, they live better than those who aren&#39;t as hardworking and intelligent.  So with that said, I think this woman should just take what she got and not feel guilty about it, everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.",1
12809,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not sure what the point of her talk was.  &quot;I&#39;m a model and I&#39;m aware I got lucky.  You should all be aware of it too!  Thanks, good bye!&quot;",1
12810,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,the stat about black and latino boys are a little misleading.  Many of them live in the ghettos where crime is high so naturally many of them will be stopped.  Your wealth has much more to do with how you&#39;re treated.  If those same young men grew up in the Hamptons they would not be stopped.  Riches &gt; Looks always.,1
12811,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Up to a point, I think that&#39;s true. The good thing is, that Ms Russell is doing what she can to draw attention to this awful situation. It would be considerabley worse if she chose to just keep her yap shut. And that certainly goes on, apart from the binging and purging, and then their gobs are wide open for those few minutes. What a weird world we live in.",1
12812,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I appreciate that she recognizes that the pictures that they take of her are not of her but a construction, a creation in the mind of some deceiver some where.

OK, so you know you&#39;re deceiving people by continuing in this line of work, so my question is why are you doing it?

You are damaging so many young girls, and boys too.

",1
12813,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Someone can&#39;t take complements. ,1
12814,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So if white and asian people are clearly 10000 times more beautiful than black (with their primitive facial features and dark skin) its called privilege? Why cant we call what&#39;s beautiful, beautiful and whats ugly ugly? Its all political correctness anyway. Because everyone is aware of the truth",1
12815,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"and what does make it right?
Bible? Laws? Laws were made by either one person or a group chosen by the majority. You are a delusional little thing.
But that was a dumb example, because i was talking about what the world perceives as beautiful 
If a majority thinks something is beautiful, it is beautiful. If people fidn something ugly, it is ugly. You dont understand its all relative. You can be beautiful to 1 person or 100, and at the same time not be beautiful, as you are ugly to 1 billion ppl",1
12816,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sadly TED talks are falling off! Wtf was this lady&#39;s point,  this isn&#39;t groundbreaking.",1
12817,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t really get what is the point she is making. She&#39;s beautiful, she&#39;s privileged, she is kinda sad that not everyone is as lucky, she is kinda sad that she now cannot become the president any more because models are considered as dumb and mindless. So what now? ",1
12818,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I really liked the part about &quot;cashing out&quot; on something she was not really responsible for. My daughter, a girl whose looks have also provoked jealousy in other girls &amp; admiration &amp; privilege from others, asked me if she could be a model. &quot;Absolutely not!&quot; I always resisted her please to be allowed to model. Now she&#39;s gotten over it but still faces peers who are either intimidated by her looks or jealous of her looks. She pretty much ignores all that!",1
12819,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fabulous! Very smart young lady with a valueable message,1
12820,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i gave it a like when i saw the title. Damn i&#39;ve waited my whole life to hear this. Goosebumps. ,1
12821,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"hey, want to buy me a drink?",1
12822,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"pfffff, whocares. Hunting nice looking female is nature animal behaviour of men., Darwinism evolutionary can tell this behaviour is totally normal.
HUman are just animal behaviour conducted . nothing special other than that.",1
12823,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Look at things in every perspective, not just yours. It&#39;s not all about you.",1
12824,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You didn&#39;t transform the view I still have from you. You are superficial, you CARE about Twitter. Period.",1
12825,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Honestly in the beginning I thought she was the typical superficial shallow model. But now I am so into her because of her personality and intellect. Awww!,1
12826,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I reckon you&#39;re wrong ... on so many levels,1
12827,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Your over-sensitivity to what you call her &quot;white guilt&quot; (and your labelling of it as such) is really jarring.  She obviously struggled to get it together and across. That is what helps make it a gem. ,1
12828,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I agree: Taking the talk that way both weakened her actual point (Looks are subjective) and belittled the very separate issue of racism in society - which runs way deeper than just &quot;looking different&quot;.,1
12829,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People like to be complimented but be serious as us guys we&#39;ll go for beauty many many times without realizing how stupid it is to go for looks rather than what&#39;s inside.,1
12830,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So you want me to call ya ugly then? Cause I will!,1
12831,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So, what I took away from that is that you&#39;re a dumb bitch. You rejected someone for complimenting you on how you look? It doesn&#39;t matter WHO the fuck you are, everyone likes to be told nice things about themselves. And someone who isn&#39;t pretty to me, might be pretty to the next guy. Sometimes people tell someone they look nice because they are just being polite. But to reject someone for doing what&#39;s considered the social norm seems like a cuntish thing to do. Get off your high horse.",1
12832,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"consistent to what most humans say, pick up &quot;artists&quot; are complete total insecure losers who need the attention of women to validate themselves as men.",1
12833,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,some truth here but the white guilt makes me want to puke,1
12834,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Loved her talk and shes right but its not just white privilege. Wont deny color has a part but its also about were youre from and what youre worth. I grew up in the projects in a mostly white ghetto, and we got treated the same way. Frisked by cops for no reason, denied for jobs, pulled over in rich neighborhoods, drugs, deaths etc. 
Theres plenty of privileged rich latinos and even blacks. I will admit the darker your skin has some effect but IMO and experience its more about what youre worth.",1
12835,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"bad luck with girls huh?
everyones different, and everyone has different tastes. not everygirl who looks like a model wants a chiselled guy.",1
12836,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you&#39;re ignorant buddy,1
12837,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Doesn&#39;t matter how insecure she is, all the ethnics and uggos in pick-up seminars who read all the dating books haven&#39;t got a chance in fuck, despite what the puas and the women themselves will tell you. In fact women are far shallower than men when it comes to looks, and if you&#39;re short changed in that area then only the green $tuff can overcome it. But you&#39;d have to fuck her knowing she&#39;ll never get crazy with lust for you like she would with a ripped stud with absolutely nothing to his name.",1
12838,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Red Pill stuff doesn&#39;t quite shift books and bootcamps the same way.,1
12839,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Fuck off, you spamming piece of trash!",1
12840,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This sounds like a lot of bullshit self-hate. I&#39;m a white guy, below average looking. A huge part of how people look is out of their control, it&#39;s how people are born. But seeing a handsome guy apologize for being handsome is just stupid and won&#39;t make anyone feel better about themselves. If you do, you&#39;re butthurt, that simple. If you&#39;re beautiful enjoy your life, sincerely.",1
12841,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"We talk about having a good self image, then we slam ourselves for what we are publicly. Very few people are 100% happy with their body-who cares, deal with it. Man, society is weak",1
12842,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love white people who don&#39;t deny the reality of white privilege!  What a bold statement, so refreshingly honest.",1

12847,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&gt;&quot;I have never had a boyfriend&quot;
&gt;judging sexuality
&gt;calling herself privileged and &quot;white&quot;
Into the trash it goes!",1
12848,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This speech is good but have to challenge some points. First the lack of non white models. Who is the marketplace? Break down the women who buy these high end expensive clothes and they probably are white women - simply because they are the majority in that market within those socio economic factors. Another thing is if modeling didn&#39;t work as marketing then it simply wouldn&#39;t survive - buyers want fantasy. Would real life and common body types sell these clothes?? I highly doubt it.,1
12849,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Talking to people would be what her &quot;powers that be&quot; handlers would NOT want, and all the more reason to do it. I applaud her discernment, her congruency throughout the ordeal to stand in front of this scrutiny and deliver through her nervousness. I saw this sentiment displayed in a Brad Pitt interview as well, where he intimates the question to his mother about why he &quot;breezes through life&quot;. Check that out. It&#39;s an eye opener.
",1
12850,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thanks for sharing (honestly) what&#39;s actually involved.  My ex was a &#39;high profile&#39; model, who I won&#39;t name here, but I will say that it&#39;s a privileged experience to be on the inside track of a HIGHLY misunderstood &#39;career&#39; (my perspective of over 6+yrs). I commend you for sharing your journey. Specifically, who models are as people vs the general (stereotypical) perception, how you are a &#39;construction&#39; and so much more. It&#39;s identical to the experiences of my ex and I think people need to know.",1
12851,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,finally,1
12852,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s a privilege that you can use your beauty to be in the modeling industry, I like you and you are smart, you can use it to help our problematic society, It has nothing to do with being black and hispanic getting frisk in New York.
If you want to talk about unfairness, look at the world around you, human slavery is still in practice these day in many countries and in the slump people pick trash for living and our welfare system doesn&#39;t work! Help yourself first before you can ask for help!",1
12853,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Didn&#39;t you notice how nervous she is? I think it&#39;s great she had the courage to do it - especially since she is benefitting from it. Gotta lover our contradictions, and I mean that with all sincerety.",1
12854,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,bull shit she is inscure shes talking on stage.,1
12855,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ed norton&#39;s decent looking. ,1
12856,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,they go to enjoy themselves but are open to meeting men just as long as you meeting their standards. I have very attractive friends who approach women everywhere and never get resistance and always get numbers. And I&#39;m very aware I am not going to get every girl. ,1
12857,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not unhappy about it at all. I&#39;m actually doing a lot with my life. I&#39;m going to school, have a 3.7 GPA, have saved up 60K as a student and am planning to go to grad school. Pretty happy with my looks. All I am saying is that looks a huge play a foundation in the dating game. And I disagree about women not being open to being picked up by strangers. Again, if she likes your looks and you act normal, she will be open to it. Thats why women go to bars and clubs.",1
12858,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You&#39;re not going to get girls every time.  Not all women are the same, some just aren&#39;t into being picked up by strangers no matter how attractive.  If you are only satisfied with your appearance based on whether or not you pick up girls every time life will be cruel to you, especially north of age 40.
Where are you vs. where do you want to be? (be realistic)  That&#39;s how satisfied you should be.  You got better genes than me and seem to be less happy about it.",1
12859,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, and thats my point. IT doesn&#39;t matter how you meet a girl...social circle, class, through work, at a friends place..if she doesn&#39;t like your looks, she won&#39;t care for your other personality traits.  Only a high amount of money or status will attractive her to you if she doesn&#39;t like your looks but most males don&#39;t have that at a young age. ",1
12860,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Regardless of location, the method of walking up to a girl you&#39;ve never met before and trying to get her to go out with you is stacking the deck in favor of the better looking.  They judge on looks alone because its all they know about you.  If you have something else to offer find a subtle way to show it off.  For example I like to take girls to beginner&#39;s sailing, it shows my fitness, wealth, and confidence (obvious I can already do it) without me coming off like an asshole.",1
12861,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, but again it is limiting. We cannot transform into a model unless we have surgery. Trust me, I&#39;m 6.3, 200 pounds 10% body fat and i don&#39;t get girls every time despite by height and physique and style. My face has some noticeable flaws, which I cannot change without surgery. ",1
12862,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Working on your looks is your best investment&quot; my original point exactly.  If you don&#39;t like the way you look do something about it.  Despite getting genetically short changed I am happy with my body image.
I know this keeping diving back into a question of sexual attraction but my real problem with the statement of dissatisfaction with physical appearance and not being able to do anything about it.",1
12863,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Also clubs, bars, libraries, schools, coffee shops...all the same thing. A girl will reject you or not based on your looks within seconds. IT works the same everywhere.",1
12864,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not jaded. It&#39;s true. I meet girls in clubs all the time and sometimes I don&#39;t. It&#39;s a harsh reality and just giving you some advice so you don&#39;t waste your time. Working on your looks is your best investment,1
12865,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The asshole comment was really more of a joke.
You sound pretty jaded about the whole thing, I take it your trying to meet girls at clubs/bars?  That really stacks the deck for the more attractive.  You may want to try something else.  What ever qualities you have find a way to showcase those, and I promise confidence helps.
Without being an asshole:)",1
12866,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ever seen Fight Club?  Picture Ed Norton&#39;s face on Brad Pitt&#39;s body.  That&#39;s about what I&#39;m dealing with.  I&#39;m already athletic and muscular, I could become a total muscle tank but I would still be small.
I could do as you say but I&#39;d be the male equivalent of the girl with fake breasts, hair extensions, and an unnatural tan.  Which I find repulsive, plus it reeks of insecurity.
I am what I am, I&#39;ve done the best I can with my cards and I&#39;m happy with it.  ",1

Don&#39;t go out there trying to be an asshole and expect women to like you for your &quot;personality.&quot; You cannot build attraction if she doesn&#39;t like you from the start. Looks matter. This is the red pill to dating. Blue pill stuff tells you &quot;personality matters and confidence.&quot; They matter to an extent (maybe in LT-relationships), but looks rule.",1
12870,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No no no no mate your doing it wrong. Glad you put this out. 1) Please start lifting weights. This is a must.

12877,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,oh.. she&#39;s just got changed.  She&#39;s not so hot anymore.  I&#39;M JOKING!!! although ironically her doing this post makes her more attractive,1
12878,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"there&#39;s been a study about the universal features of beauty in women and it&#39;s these: clear skin, high cheek bones, waist/hip ratio of 0.7 and symmetric faces. Everything else is shaped by culture and our personal ideas of beauty.",1
12879,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,holy mother of god I would tap dat!,1
12880,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I feel like the title of this video directly contradicts what she&#39;s saying. In this video, she describes how easy, being a physically attractive girl, it was for her to be liked and to avoid trouble. Let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s definitely easy for someone to be handsome or beautiful in society, and they even get chosen for job/better opportunities rather than an ugly person with the same attributes. It&#39;s that our concept of beauty has been skewed severely.",1
12881,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Could have done without the references to affirmative action and &#39;gender and racial oppression&#39;. Racial profiling by the police doesn&#39;t indicate anything more than common sense.,1

12884,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This was great. It&#39;s nice to hear the other side of things every now and then. Every time I hear or watch models talk about their work, you can usually tell when they&#39;re hiding things, like the downsides if their jobs, but this was very straightforward and honest.

12890,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Most faces look better leaner. Not talking about anareoxic thing. For males ESPECIALLY, lean faces are important to emphasize jaw line, cheek bones, chin, etc. The people I find attractive all follow a set of guidelines: They have one or a few appealing facial features, symmetrical face. Of course, when you see a personal that everyone will find attractive, it is obvious. You rarely see those though (e.g. Bradd Pitt, George Cloney). But they exist.",1
12891,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is a pretty strange one TEd it seems to me like she is trying to make me feel sorry for her for being hot, I know the message she was trying to portray but I think that her speech got lost in translation even though as I said her was in the right place for it",1
12892,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Some faces do not look better thin. And there are plenty of men i know who like larger women. Think about the people you&#39;ve encountered so far. Do most of them fall into a certain demographic? Then your conclusions are not universal.,1
12893,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,did you even watch this through...,1
12894,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What is she talking about? :) Latinas and Indians are the most beautiful girls. Few pale guys with money hired pale girls does not mean everybody thinks the same. Everybody has their own definition of beauty. Anybody can be constructed into so called &#39;beautiful&#39; image but only few are naturally beautiful and to me they are Indians and Latinas. So, it is wrong to say that because some institute hired more of one race that race is more beautiful.",1
12895,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Is that because your brains are as useless as your ears? She never said she was over 30. And if you could do math you would figure when she posted her _FIRST_ image dated 2003- at the age of 16, and been a model for 10 years... That would make her around 26 years old.

12897,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"beauty is objective. Everywhere you go, certain features are considered attractive. Certain people are considered attractive. People should always take care of their bodies. 30 pounds of fat will have a huge effect on your face, obviously. Throw 30 pounds of fat on Cameron Russell and it will change her whole face. But even fit, muscular guys still get rejected because of their face, not there body. That is all",1

12900,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t think anyone should be unhappy overall but to be unhappy with part of ourselves and want to change is a good thing.  A large part of happiness in life is the pursuit of our ideals.  Whether your goals are social, economic, or even physical there is happiness in achievement.  I take pride in doing the best I can with my genetic lottery. ",1
12901,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Look arguing the laws of beauty is pointless, is subjective.  But just to share my two cents; if your overweight you&#39;re not attractive.  Even a little makes a big difference.  To my eye 30 lbs of body fat will overcome any face.",1
12902,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"True, if your an average looking guy you are you&#39;ll get an average looking girl unless you&#39;ve got something else going for you.  I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen the &quot;undateable&quot; episode of Seinfeld but that&#39;s the world we live in.
The point I&#39;m trying to make is that most people that are unsatisfied with there appearance are out of shape.  Model level beauty isn&#39;t achievable for most but significant improvement is possible.",1
12903,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Look at how many athletes have great bodies but have average faces...there great body does not make them attractive. Anyone can get a great body. Being in shape is easy but people don&#39;t have the mental strength to do it. And no, a lot of people don&#39;t have a truly ugly face, but many people have average faces and if your an average male in this life, dating will be much harder. average females have more options then average males.",1
12904,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Face determines your overall attractiveness. You are missing the point. First off, being overweight will make you unattractive UNLESS you have an amazing face.(e.g some Lane Bryant models). But, even  if you drop that weight, your face will be around he same unless you had A LOT OF FAT. Losing weight will make the difference in some, and in some it won&#39;t. If your face isn&#39;t attractive, losing weight will make you more attractive BUT IT WONT MAKE YOU ATTRACTIVE.",1
12905,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s not a hypocrite. She&#39;s only telling girls that there&#39;s more to life than modeling. There are bigger and better things out there, which she knows, because she went to Columbia University and majored in economics and political science. She&#39;s just telling girls that modeling is only a career for a small percentage of men and women. She happens to be one of them, but that doesn&#39;t make her a hypocrite. ",1
12906,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That 86% of people stopped and frisked that were black and latino? That leaves 14% who aren&#39;t black or latino. You happen to be part of that 14%. She also says &quot;teenagers&quot;. You&#39;re 25, which puts you in a whole other generation.
You&#39;re clearly missing the point of this entire talk. 78% of girls shouldn&#39;t be unhappy with their body. People shouldn&#39;t have to feel like they need to change their bodies in order to be happy. They should be fine with having acne and braces, and not want to change.",1
12907,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The face is important but how many have a truly ugly face?  Very few in comparison to how many have ugly bodies.  Something like 65% of adults are overweight (I don&#39;t think anyone would say 65% have an ugly face) and 80% of women are not happy with their body image.  Do the math.  If we were all in shape the percentage of women that are dissatisfied with their image would be more like 20% than 80%,1

Eh? You dont understand the difference of &#39;being beautiful to someone&#39;, and &#39;being beautiful&#39;. 
Being beautiful is being beautiful to majority. A person who is beautiful to 6000 people is uglier than a person who is beautiful to 5 billion people. You just dont understand what you&#39;re talking about. Yeah you don&#39;t have a brain. And you must be very ugly and insecure",1

Don&#39;t be rude. We might see many a people, but not all of it is nice or fair. (See 600+ vs. 27.)

If you go to africa you will see much higher % of population is ugly and Asia + Europe are soo beautiful compared to them.

12985,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What good is it for all these woman to get dressed up to the hilt if there is a growing percentage of unemployed men?,1
12986,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Another interesting thing about the fashion industry is that it is essentially molded by gay male designers who prefer androgeny, thinness in order to cut less fabric, and less curves for a lithe silhoette. The fashion industry then influences the physical preferences of males by selecting the model archetypes to be displayed in countless magazines, commercials, etc. It&#39;s no wonder that this ends up molding what consumerist men (which are most in America) find attractive what women aspire to be.",1
12987,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Everything she&#39;s saying is 100% real. This is how it is in Anglo-American culture, and the experience of people who don&#39;t look like her. Props to her keeping it real. Wish more anglos would be gutsy enough to do the same.",1
12988,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Because of the dedication you have to have even if you are genetically smarter. Maybe I&#39;m just a little biased but, I do get that some people are doomed since the moment they were born, either by country, race, looks or intelligence.
There&#39;s got to be something we can do about this (not eugenics).",1

12991,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fuck white guilt.,1
12992,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What did she say? I was too busy admiring how pretty she was :) Good on her. Models don&#39;t normally speak in public, partly because they don&#39;t normally have anything intelligent to say (let alone remember the script).",1
12993,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Profile Everyone. you can learn a lot about what someone is going to do by how they look and what they do in a short period amount of time. Cops have to profile people or else they could lose their lives and if they just ignore the obvious to appeal to the need of people wanting everyone to stop judging by race and religion.,1
12994,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I kinda wish she talked a bit longer. I feel like the topic she got into wasn&#39;t fleshed out enough too truly gleen her perspective,1
12995,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I disagree, she seems intelligent. Did you really just disregard everything she had to say just because of a pretty face? Nice job proving her right with her entire speech about how appearance effects our judgement ",1
12996,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;being comfortable acknowledging the power of image in perceived success and failure&quot;... does that resonate on stating that &quot;looks isn&#39;t everything&quot;? for me, she just acknowledged that it is there and it is real... further banking on the stigma.  I feel like she&#39;s just saying that &quot;ok I&#39;ve won the genetic lottery and I&#39;ve got all these perks, but still I feel insecure.&quot; Further cementing the fact that stigma is still going to be there, and we are all bunch of insecure people...

12999,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think stigma, be it good or bad, is always detrimental. Getting favors for thinks you cannot change are incredibly demeaning i think, so i kinda agree with her. ",1
13000,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I loved it! She seemed honest and delivered the speech very eloquently.,1
13001,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She actually seems quite intelligent,1
13002,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,As a supermodel her life must be miserable.  Most supermodels are anorexic and on drugs just so they can keep up with the lifestyle of being a supermodel.  ,1
13003,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beauty is fleeting as well as subjective. Self proclaiming you are beautiful when you were selected by white males (who most likely don&#39;t even &quot;Like&quot; girls) is pretty bombastic. Women are influenced by models, men are impressed by strippers. The two couldn&#39;t be more different.",1
13004,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,well its the first thing you see...the rest doesnt become apparent till after. is that acceptable?,1

She&#39;s not bragging or smug because of who she is and her talk was anything but vapid hot air. She gave a raw, honest, and fairly concise presentation on why image is one of the worse things to judge others on, even her. The real her is nothing like the images that her modeling suggests. As a society we desperately need to look deeper than the images we are presented, because often we&#39;re deceived with dire results.",1
13012,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hmmm profiling.,1

13016,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow awesome presentation Cameron. Glad I stuck through the first 30 seconds which made me feel this might not be good.,1
13017,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Are you okay? We were having a grown-up debate. Perhaps you need to go away and come back when you&#39;ve constructed something useful. ,1
13018,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"TED used to be good, now anyone and everyone can give TED talk...guess they ran out of smart people.",1
13019,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Basically what you&#39;re saying here is that the only women who deserve to be heard are the ones who let -- and there really is no better word for men who allow themselves to be blindly and selfishly driven by the urge to possess and consume -- pigs like you cruise over their bodies with their eyes, or the ones who mask their beauty or abandon it altogether. Shame on you. Please don&#39;t reproduce until you learn that your thinking-cells reside in your brain, not your genitals.",1

Good job proving her point, people.",1
13021,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Way to walk in someone else&#39;s shoes guys! She doesn&#39;t want sympathy she wants you to be happier with who you are and, accept it instead of wanting to be her from the perception you have of her life. It&#39;s not about how she looks its about how people see her",1
13022,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;The burden of being beautiful&quot;. My heart bleeds. I&#39;m really struggling to muster sympathy here.,1
13023,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Quite the courage.,1
13024,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I thought it was a pretty funny comment.  You understand humor? but what is the argument here actually? If youre beautiful maybe theres more to life than money and modelling? Ok captain obvious, How many years of so called adult intellectual genius did it take to figure that out?  thought TED talks were for intellectuals?  If being beautiful is such a disadvantage you can always try out facial disfigurement.  Then you can understand the meaning of the word burden.  ",1
13025,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I like that she points out her privilege while most would simply deny it exists, but I am also disappointed because she has potential to do more things like this TED talk, yet she continues to model and benefit from the very industry she criticizes. I can&#39;t applaud this because she says one thing then does the other.",1
13026,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron, I know with over a million views this message will never get to you, however, you rocked your talk. I think you did a great job being real, and vulnerable and powerful. I suspect, and hope, that don&#39;t need to hear that, because you already know it. I&#39;m happy for you, and very proud of you. Great job!",1
13027,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Intellegent and pretty i think im in love,1

13030,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really like the in the normal dress,1
13031,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is not saying that &quot;Beauty is such a drag&quot; but rather the act of not centering your decisions and career path on your &quot;genetic lottery&quot; of beauty.,1
13032,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"He&#39;s telling the truth though, a lot of men simply look at the appearance",1
13033,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a lot of people don&#39;t realize is that racial profiling does save lives.,1
13034,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thats rude.,1
13035,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I commend this lovely lady for such a truthful talk. May we all see this truth and live it!,1
13036,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You really are a simple man - in all means of the word &quot;simple&quot;.,1
13037,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But, that TED talk on the theory of everything would still get views. Einstein wan&#39;t a particularly attractive man, yet he&#39;s a household name. Mother Theresa isn&#39;t known for her banging good looks. Looks aren&#39;t EVERYTHING, but they are important. If Justin Beiber was actually talented, he would still gain notoriety, but perhaps not as much as he has.",1
13038,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not at all. There is nothing ignorant about somebody looking attractive. It&#39;s more ignorant to deny its existence.  And bigotry? Your the bigot here. I have an open mind on all subjects. ,1
13039,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a whiner. Such a hypocrite. She&#39;ll still end up marrying some rich old dude or some brainless but goodlooking DJ/actor/male model. And she&#39;ll continue to enjoy each and every one of the &#39;genetic advantages&#39; she didn&#39;t do anything for to earn herself. ,1
13040,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"plus, she was saying that she made a mistake by making this choice to be a model. but she couldn&#39;t go back to have another job, because models are &#39;just&#39; models. in addition, she was saying that this all belongs to a false social construct which says that you ARE how you LOOK, which you just showed you belonged to (i don&#39;t blame you) by saying that since she looks like she&#39;s better by being socially privileged, than she is. ",1
13041,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"no, she said she wasn&#39;t HAPPY about it. HAPPINESS DOESN&#39;T COME FROM PRIVILEGE. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO ENVY HER. didn&#39;t you see how she was sexualized when she was a kid? would you really like to go through the same thing just for money? if yes, you&#39;re some fucked up person and I&#39;m sorry for you",1
13042,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i love that woman,1
13043,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"that&#39;s because you should think for yourself
",1
13044,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She basically just said that looks are important to how other people perceive one another, and that you can benefit from looking the right way. She went on too much about what models got and didnt stress the message she meant to stress, that  we shouldn&#39;t judge a book by its cover.",1
13045,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is why I have life. She is both hot and smart while I&#39;m only slightly smart... and a resentful asshole.,1
13046,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s brilliantttt,1
13047,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,really goo talk.. ,1
13048,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"whoever is saying she&#39;s not beautiful is lying. Looks are one of the most important things in life and unfortunately you cant work hard to earn good looks, its genetic. Only thing you can do is keep slim but if you don&#39;t have the face or the legs which are genetic you&#39;re not gonna be a model.",1

What if i say you are ugly - would you believe it ?

So, what does it matter - if you believe it.. or not ?",1
13052,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Someone I would really like to meet, not for the usual reasons. She is obviously very intelligent and not afraid to call things like she sees them. I think she would be a very enjoyable person to have a conversation with for the best reasons - you tend to take on the traits of those you spend time with, and who doesn&#39;t need to be a bit more clear-thinking and even-keeled. I look forward to watching any other talks you give on subjects you feel strongly about. Very commendable.
",1
13053,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"whoaaaaaa there. whoa. o_____o
she hardly even looks like she has any make up on. and why does not having make up on mean she wouldn&#39;t be standing up talking about this subject? she&#39;s very beautiful with minimal make up.",1
13054,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she dident say she was makeing herself look less hot, i think it made her look more aprochable.",1
13055,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Know this? The man is my hero. Did you know there are plans for a huge Tesla museum?
Google : Nikola Tesla museum campaign guardian. You&#39;ll see an amazing article on it. The man has become bigger than Edison.

13057,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes... blame your ignorance and bigotry on your genome. How else can you sleep at night? ,1
13058,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Live isn&#39;t fair. Anybody claiming we all have the same chances in life is obviously delusional. 
Famous example? Edison versus a lot of smart people who invented stuff. Like Tesla. Edison didn&#39;t invent shit. He was a master salesman. He made money of of other peoples inventions. Tesla wanted to improve the world and left his inventions out there for everyone and Edison picked them up and patented them and made a bundle. The American way. 

Cashing in on what you do (or are) is the American way",1
13059,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I totally agree with you. I was actually trying to exemplify that and i was being honest.  However i also know many women who are secretly very hot but they were able to put forward other aspects of their selves while hiding their sexual attractiveness.  Powerful, successful women who tone down their curves, sex appeal etc. Why  avoid sexual attractiveness to be a part of your character? If you can be interesting without being hot then do it and don&#39;t bitch about it or get free pass from cops.",1
13060,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"you mean the legacy of the human genome?
",1
13061,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Its a troll making fun of guys. Your an ass.,1
13062,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Honesty from one of the few brave souls of the &quot;image&quot; industry. Nice.,1
13063,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Image yes, but &#39;good looking&#39; of that biological image is defined by healthy looking (&#39;necessary for procreation&#39;) and strong (traits that females want passed on to the progeny).
She touches over those only very briefly.
What may be more interesting is if someone was talking how these concepts of self-image are changing (and they are, as more leisure time and idiot-proof society makes other things important from an evolutionary standpoint)
but she does not even touch that.
",1
13064,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Clearly you are one of brainwashed products of the legacy she was talking about. I feel awful to live in a society plagued by you and the likes of you.,1
13065,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It is not a boast but stating a fact. Being pretty is winning the genetic lottery basically.
But there is a conceptual correction, a lottery is random and anyone can do it. Beauty is less random, it is about eugenics, and eventually only a certain social group will benefit from it.",1
13066,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You are missing the forest.
The point here is that we humans are biased by image, there are tons of academic research regarding to it. It is not only a social bias, but actually a biological one, and it is so impervious that nobody really think that they are biased until they think that the one that is good-looking &quot;can&#39;t be a bad person&quot;.",1
13067,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Part 2
If she were being honest she would talk about how does she feel up on the ramp, in a photo shoot etc. not about cliched, &#39;I won the genetic lottery&#39;.
Does a good orator say that ever? Even though oratory requires the gift of unimpedimented speech.
or does a good mathematician say that?
How about that billionaire businessman?
A lot many people aspire to be those as well, a lot many more than models actually.
yet none of them say that, because they aren&#39;t as self absorbed",1
13068,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Part 1
She is describing a sector of modeling industry (runway modelling), that too in a small part of this world.
What she does end up doing is telling some little girls that they are not &#39;the chosen ones&#39;  is self-absorbed.
People appreciate designers and photographers more than many of these &#39;models&#39;, save for a few amongst event them, but that requires more than a genetic lottery. 
Those little girls strive to be appreciated and liked, not to be models, something to do with self-image",1
13069,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She was just describing the modeling industry and how the industry views and picks models. That isn&#39;t really her definition of what is beautiful, that is what the modeling industry finds to be beautiful. How that makes her self-absorbed... I don&#39;t know.",1
13070,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Okay, this video is kinda dumb.
First she doesn&#39;t look any different with the dress change.
By her definition, Indian or women of African or even Mediterranean descent cannot be considered beautiful (last I heard the world considers olive skinned women to be the most beautiful).
Next her definition of modelling considers only bony assed clothes racks on the runway.
Plus sized models? models that actually have to engage the public at shows and stuff, nah.
Self absorbed much, chickie? ",1
13071,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She sounds very honest and very brave and rational. The combination made me weep! Crikey.,1
13072,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I watched your video because you are hot. Not because of the title or TED. Embrace your beauty. I would be inclined to buy whatever you are selling. I like things simple. I prefer beautiful people to look attractive and people making an intellectual point to look academic. Whatever you say up there, i will imagine you naked. I will do that because i am a simple man. I hate the &#39;beauty is such a drag&#39; argument but i would have been more interested in your argument if you have showed more skin.",1
13073,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was brave of her :D,1

Still looks just as hot.",1
13083,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s not professional, but its real. Good job.",1
13084,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, that was a legitimate and honest talk.  Took some real brass to get up there and say that.  Intelligent people cheer for the underdog, but it was an interesting twist to see someone who won the genetic jackpot explain downsides, and, more importantly, that she realizes it is unjust.",1

I&#39;m more concerned that you&#39;re attempting to demean Cameron Russel for no reason. :/",1

13088,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t get the point.,1
13089,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You&#39;re absolutely right. They also view overweight women as more attractive as well. That MAY have something to do with Africa being in a state that the western world was in a couple hundred years ago, which is when we viewed light skinned fat women as more attractive. But I don&#39;t know.",1
13090,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,its about time a hot girl spoke the truth,1
13091,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I see her inner beauty,1
13092,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Attractiveness is based on what we would find to be a suitable mate. I like women to be healthy, for example. Well, that&#39;s not just me, that&#39;s pretty much everyone. It would be detrimental to the species for men to be attracted to sickly, diseased women.
So unless someone is mentally ill, they&#39;re not going to say someone like Jessica Alba is ugly. She may be the most beautiful girl in the world to some and just simply pretty to others, but she&#39;s ugly to no one.

So there is bit of a standard.",1
13093,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The times have changed, though. People used to think fat women were attractive. Now it&#39;s skinny women. It used to be fair women, and now it&#39;s tan women. It all has to do with money. When food was scarce, fat women were attractive because it was evident they had money. When people used to have to work outside all the time, a fair woman evidently had money to stay in the shade and not have to go out in the sun.

Now it&#39;s the opposite.",1
13094,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t know why, because people nowadays view tans as more attractive than pale skin.",1
13095,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is not mocked, I am not mocking her, she has gotten over 2.1 million views, she has a great life. why are you defending her ? You don&#39;t even know the woman. And I think truth hearing from an ugly person makes people say &#39; who does she think she is, she is not popular, why would I listen to her, as many Youtube videos can confirm, mostly the good looking charming people get the most views, not the winy ugly ones, as now again shown by this video as well.",1
13096,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If the title hadn&#39;t had the word &#39;Model&#39; in it,and was represented by an ugly to moderate looking woman, it wouldn&#39;t have had over 1.2 million views.This is the truth, this is how we respond, even to this video, and also people here start defending the model as if they know her, its how people are, we deny it, its right there, we are meaner to ugly people, good looking people get better jobs, yet there is nothing any of us do about it, sad but true.",1

wow i never knew that ",1

13100,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t get why people think white women are the most attractive. Latin women and Asian women are beautiful too. They can be models just as easily as white women can. So I think it has more to do with the fact that in America, the majority of women are white. You&#39;d also have to look up the demographic on who is actually trying to become models. If it&#39;s 95% white women, then it&#39;s no surprise 95% of models are white.

But that&#39;s only American models. I bet all the models in Asia are Asian.",1
13101,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Talks title &quot;Looks Aren&#39;t Everything&quot; the talk &quot;Looks Are Everything&quot;,1
13102,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Actually, a lot of people, including myself, want and need to hear the truth from a Have. The problem is the sad fact that she, and others like her, are not offering any solutions to the problem of imagery. Little or no blame should come towards her. The majority of the blame should go to the general public and their misguided priorities, specifically the dumb store workers who gave her a free dress, and the cop who let her and her friend go. What she stated is nothing new. I&#39;m sorry. ",1

There&#39;s no reason for you to feel guilty about all the attention you get. Though it&#39;s not smart to rub peoples faces in it. I hope you learn to relax and enjoy life more.",1
13105,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think that very attractive women do tend to be very insecure about their looks, as you say. But i think that it&#39;s mostly because they attract so very many narcissistic people around them who value looks and latch on for the percieved reflected glory. I was considered quite attractive, and yes, i got perks, like being invited backstage, go to fancy parties which someone wants stocked with &quot;babes.&quot; But i think there were plenty of drawbacks. A lot of envy and aggression.",1

13107,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s certainly unrevealing but I don&#39;t think we should already know what she said as it&#39;s not factual such as describing fellow models has having ideal physical attributes... this is a common public perception rather than a actual reality as some would say that a woman with giant natural tits, laugh lines and child bearing hips is ideal and so on.",1
13108,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You can trust an American to describe themselves as sexy, more beautiful than most people and strongly suggest sexually provoking as a factual statement. 
One fact that I know is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all I see is potential beauty which is yet to be untangled.",1

I know a couple of young beautiful girls who all have certain things in common. They all got a lot of attention and a lot of offers from people who have a lot to offer....
But they are all also insecure individuals.",1
13114,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Reading the comments below has validated her point very much so, for me!",1

13116,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I do understand your point but I just have no affection for her, sorry.",1
13117,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It seems that her main point was made best when she talked about how she is getting &quot;free things&quot; for her looks and not her character and other people are paying a cost for their looks and not their character.  She&#39;s not saying her life is unfair, but that everything is unfair, and she even acknowledges that she&#39;s benefited from superficiality.",1
13118,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She can&#39;t change what she was born into just like people less fortunate can&#39;t change what they&#39;re born into.,1
13119,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love the way she says the word &quot;perceived&quot; at the end o_____o,1
13120,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I feel like everyone that is focusing on her woe is me (which that wasn&#39;t the point) missed the big picture of her presentation -_-,1
13121,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Were i to pass her in the street i would probably appreciate how pretty she is (which she is, there is now denying that) however i do object to the &#39;woe is me&#39; routine. As problems go being beautiful isn&#39;t ever going to top the list, and she isn&#39;t ever going to garner much sympathy. We try to give weight to her argument because she has a platform if she stopped you in the street and told you how people judge her harshly for her looks, would you still be so sympathetic?",1
13122,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I do appreciate what you&#39;re saying but being a model and whining about how people judge you for your looks is like a millionaire whining about how hard it is to spend money to a person who has none. Lets be honest nobody really cares how much of a rough ride she gets for being &#39;beautiful&#39; she&#39;s made a very good living from it after all. I think i&#39;ll save my sympathy for someone who really deserves it. And i didn&#39;t say that intelligence was dictated by an individual&#39;s appearance.,1
13123,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But aren&#39;t you judging her negatively simply because of the way she looks?  Is it only okay for an &quot;ugly&quot; person to acknowledge the truth of how our world works?  You assume she is being arrogant but if a physically unattractive person had bravely stood up there, with everyone staring, and made the same (very valid) points, wouldn&#39;t you have taken them more seriously?  I think this type of reaction, which seems typical given the comments, only proves the truth of her statements.",1
13124,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she did a great job and one of the most poignant statements that she made: &quot;It is difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries.&quot; is something that is very hard to acknowledge when you know that, despite your honesty and your sincerity, you will STILL be mocked, invalidated and judged harshly by others who cannot see past your exterior to the human being within.  Because no one wants to hear the truth from a Have, only a Have Not.",1
13125,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t think she meant that people hate her because of her looks, but that people judge her, like they judge everyone else, based on their looks. She can talk about the prejudice people have towards &quot;beautiful&quot; people because she makes her living from her looks. She was trying to say that appearance isn&#39;t everything. Looks don&#39;t dictate your intelligence or persona.",1
13126,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Really like and respect this girl , nice one",1

Without her looks, she would NEVER have gotten this gig, so... come and talk about looks not being important - when it is the ONE AND ONLY reason that she&#39;s standing there in the FIRST place. The mind boggles and I&#39;m still reeling from the epic face-palm.",1
13149,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;d rate this as one of the worst TED talk in history...,1
13150,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Bla bla bla... beauty is superficial... 

That&#39;s like someone who has enough money to never have to work, let alone seeing their children starve, saying that money isn&#39;t everything. 

But worst of all, this calculating a-type c*nt knows it... coming on-stage, not wearing something ugly... not void of makeup... but artificially enhanced like a 2-dime hooker to say what?  That looks isn&#39;t everything? Blow it out your arse you stinking foul bitch!",1
13151,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"not saying that she doesn&#39;t feel that way, but the level of her address was not on par with TED talks in my opinion. It would have been much more effective had she come out with no makeup, hair undone, in a t shirt and jeans, and talk about how pretty people are treated differently. THEN reveal that she&#39;s really a model, this is what she looks like in magazines and have the audience realize that they did take more notice when they realized she was beautiful. ",1
13152,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow. Just wow. Honest, and refreshing. Thank-you.",1

In the US, the disparity between the rich and the poor has been getting bigger every year for the past 40 years or more. The richest 10% have 83% of US wealth. If you include the whole world, then the richest 1% have ~43% of all the wealth and that number is rising!",1
13155,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No, sorry.

And yes, there has and always will be bigotry and discrimination against some race, religion, economic class, etc, etc. But there is now the absolute closest ever to full equal opportunity across the board the world has ever known.

Cameron makes a good point. Judging a person based on how they look, &quot;their image,&quot; is an incredibly shallow interpretation of who they really are, yet this is how society works... That doesn&#39;t really make me feel better, though.",1

13194,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think most of what she was discussing is the reason why models are insecure. It&#39;s because of the way the world seems to treat them as if they&#39;re special. Think about the masses of people who think that the superficially constructed images are actually her. It&#39;s those images that make people see her as an object instead of a real person.

This woman is conscious and aware.  Compared to my neighbors, she is a saint.",1

13239,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,And that&#39;s the problem with people who judge by what they see.. other than what the person they&#39;re judging wants them to see.,1
13240,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Damn you women! Destroying my stereotype.. Your meant to be dumb and selfish :(,1
13241,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She clearly states her apprehensiveness in giving this TED talk, noting that people will probably think badly of her. 
She&#39;s simply pouring out what has been on her heart: that the life of a model shouldn&#39;t necessarily be sought after. Due to the insecurities she has and the sick &quot;blood money&quot; she receives, she&#39;s guilty of buying into the system and eloquently confesses it in this compelling testimony. Bravo, Ms. Russell.",1
13242,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"its ok to want to look good, to learn about the body, and act thoward what you wish to be, but, doing without knowing, is doing blindly, actions will drive to results, thats why you want knowledge to have the currect results.
doing the right actions, which sometimes are just doing nothing, is important for succeding, but there is a go or no. dont try finding half-ways or shortcuts. 
also i look in a girl for aesthetics and self carying, but also wont like her if shes too obssesed with it.",1
13243,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she meant inventor of something on the same scale as the internet, ie. something that will revolutionize the way we think about and experience the world.",1
13244,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow she nailed it,1
13245,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Haha true women are just illogical crazy people, they really don&#39;t know what they want unless they are told by men",1
13246,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s a hypocritical idiot, complaining about a situation in which she participates and gains benefit. Your logic is insanely stupid. A criminal could say; &quot;There will always be murders so untill someone smarter than me finds a way to stop all murders I will continue to murder people because I feel like it&quot;",1
13247,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is really hypocritical, if she hates the fact that she is good looking and lucky to get paid for that fact, then she should quit being a model and gain weight. But of coarse she so desperately wants money and male attention so she remains a hypocrite by benefitting off of something she is complaining about. What a typical woman",1

13250,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"TED talks are mostly if not purely based on the topic and not the person talking. Of course a celebrity would be judged on their looks and especially so if they&#39;re appealing to young minds. Appearance is a part of our infrastructure as humans as a symbol of sex, love, and reputability. Looks are important, but /all of her points remain true/.",1
13251,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"All I&#39;m hearing is &quot;I&#39;m sorry for being pretty and getting free stuff and privileges that uglier, non white people don&#39;t get.&quot;",1

13254,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"C&#39;mom man, she tried her best. I give her the credit of breaking out the hackneyed &#39;models are dumb&#39; propaganda.  ",1
13255,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thank you, I said something similar yesterday and I got shallow replies like:&quot;What are you so bitter about?&quot;. So, your comment justifies my feeling towards this shallow talk.
And, I do not care if it is a TED Talk or a TEDX talk. ",1
13256,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;the inventor of the next internet&quot; - whut?,1
13257,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Looks aren&#39;t everything because you are a model,1
13258,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"what is the message of her speech? that her job (being a model) made her a model (someone they look up to) to young girls, but causes these young girls to feel bad about their body and who they are because they don&#39;t look the same as she looks on photos, which is not really her but a construction of beauty/fashion professionals .. So what can be done to solve this on-going problem? so that young people will grow up feeling GOOD about being themselves and not wishing/hoping they are someone else?",1
13259,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow. That was one of the most open and honest talks I&#39;ve seen in a while.,1
13260,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"actually &#39;anyone&#39; can organize tedx talks, there&#39;s like no major mega judge overseer in the world, every independant organizer can chose who will speak at their event, that&#39;s why not all of them have such amazing quality, and that&#39;s why one must not believe every other bs that&#39;s said",1
13261,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I will raise awareness about the earth spinning around the sun, compared to what she said is a less known fact",1
13262,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I want you to go a very poor kid, some beggar in the street and tell him that&#39;s not big deal to eat bread and he must trust you because you eat bread often and you know how it tastes. And then tell me if he&#39;s bitter",1

",1
13264,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It was a very nothing piece that became as hollow as the industry she works in. Ironic, eh?",1
13265,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"hmm. You may have a point in regards to providing a lack of a solution to the problems she presented. But it would appear to me that her intention was to raise awareness of an issue to provoke discussion on the topic. Regardless of what you think of her character as a person she presented well and her message is, in my opinion, worth while in considering and shouldn&#39;t  be written off so easily.",1
13266,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"See, I did not miss the point but what she says is nothing new. Please see my reply to Veelah, who could not resist taking a jab at me and I quote:&quot;What are you so bitter about?&quot; I know what this lady (Veelah) means. What she means is this: &quot;What is the matter, you are jealous? You are ugly? Is that why you question such a beautiful lady?&quot; No, I question the worth of Cameron Russell&#39;s talk in TED talks. She, truly, did not add anything new to the conversation. ",1
13267,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Because I am ugly as sin. That is why I am bitter. You happy. I am saying that what am I supposed to do with this non-information. Nothing she says in her talk is new. TED talks are supposed to be high quality done by highly qualified people who bring new ideas and thoughts to people. She whines, did she give the society a new way to &quot;battle&quot; against the stupid fashion industry. Does she have any plan to modify the industry, help young models, etc. No! Madame, she does not. ",1
13268,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You have completely missed the point my friend. There are a range of things she is going over here. How even though she can look what society deems &quot;sexy&quot; she really just got lucky with genetics and on shoot being surrounded by professionals, who&#39;s jobs are to make people look &quot;sexy.&quot; Not only that but the back lash of modelling to societies standards is that she has put unreasonable pressure on girls, women and even herself to reach an unattainable look. And then I ran out of characters... :/",1
13269,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s saying that it&#39;s hard to discuss a problem that she benefits from greatly, every day.  But she obviously recognizes it.  What are you so bitter about?",1
13270,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am not sure what she is saying. Is she complaining about being a model? Then, don&#39;t be. Is she complaining about having done modeling when she was so young? Go complain to your parents for letting you do it at such a young age. And wtf does it mean: &quot;It was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the greatest beneficiaries&quot;. Oh shut up and drink your champagne and eat your caviar.",1
13271,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,COMING. FROM. A. MODEL.,1
13272,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lmao we&#39;ve all come to some very real conclusions today,1
13273,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i think its official, there is officially just as many pretty girls complaining about being too pretty as there are too many fat chicks complaining about being ugly. ",1
13274,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wtf was this bs,1
13275,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wish this talk was longer :O,1
13276,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Many people are fat from eating a lot less unhealthily than you just described. You&#39;re right that a poor enough diet can make anybody fat, but the amount of callories you need and the way that your body processes any excess callories you give it is partly genetic.",1
13277,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You were born to parents that eat a healthy diet. Getting fat doesn&#39;t take just drinking some sodas and eating some sweets. It takes drinking soda all the time. It takes eating fast food packed with HFCS. It takes eating cheap frozen food and preserved snacks from the grocery store. Not just sometimes, but for every meal, every day. This is why people get fat. You aren&#39;t skinny because of genes, you are skinny because you don&#39;t even know what it&#39;s like to eat like a fat person.",1

13279,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am kind of astonished that, for all the theoretical brilliance of the TEDtalks org., they cannot find a single person who can both understand the English language and type well enough to make the close captioning subtitles remotely intelligible.

13284,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, she&#39;s beautiful. I&#39;m not sure I believe that she wants to be judged by her personality. By contrast, I&#39;ve a number of qualities: widely read, literate, fit, martial art skillset, able to draw, able to sing and more. I&#39;m also short, bald and wear glasses. Would she look at me and wonder about my personality or just see a speccy, bald bloke? It would be the latter. Now, the beautiful Amanda Seyfried is playing Linda Lovelace. Yes, Porn is full of beautiful women too. No, I don&#39;t believe her.",1

13293,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Question 1: So they can have a companion that loves them and takes care of their children.
Question 2: Why ask this question?
Question 3: It&#39;s pretty much the opposite argument. He&#39;s giving his opinion so women know there&#39;s at least one more guy out there that is okay with some fat, and appreciates health as opposed to what you say he is encouraging.
Everybody gives opinions about everybody&#39;s body. It&#39;s how we form love interests, it&#39;s how we monitor our health and make sure people are okay.",1
13294,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Everybody is insecure. Having a healthy, thin body brings many benefits, regardless of whether you have the genes to be what the fashion industry wants in a model. This requires proper treatment of your body, not luck. She talks about how she gets free things and how it is purely because she was born that way, but that is untrue. She could have grown fat and greasy if she treated her body that way.",1
13295,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"good  speech!
",1
13296,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think it&#39;s enclosed in her interest to vocalize different topics as opposed to having one extendable treatment on a single subject. Not to diminish the value of such speech, but I thought she catered what was important and with her &quot;takeaway&quot; encapsulating a collective reasoning from her talk, I&#39;m within a great complacency. Though I am not of a female gender so our preferences may vary.",1
13297,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Teenagers do watch this, believe me, and it&#39;s incredibly inspiring :)",1
13298,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Um... no it didn&#39;t. 

If you think TED gives a flying fuck what the speaker looks like, this must be your first TED talk.",1

13300,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I knew someone  would dispute the legacy/ white privilege portion of her speech before I even looked at the comments!  I was correct. Amazing!,1
13301,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"no, cameron, looks are everything. it got you on ted.",1
13302,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Well the ethnic composition of the models at a given fashion-show is decided by the demographics of which the clothing brands actually sell the majority of their products to. Claiming that fact is some sort of underlying racism inherent in the system seems infantile and narrow-minded to me.,1

13305,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Younger people have given great ted talks, they have time to prepare ( at least a week, if not more), and she really jetted from one topic to another when she could have just really dug into one (as many of the factors of modeling and body image she brought up were on point, but very superficially touched upon). Her being nervous may inhibit they way she speaks, but her material wouldn&#39;t have changed, and that is what I was referring to. I want to hear more from her, just in a different way",1
13306,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This talk should be for kids (especially young girls) in a different media rather than on Ted, since adults probably knows what she said anyway. I doubt kids are watching Ted talks and they are the people that needs to hear this. Anyway, cute little talk.",1
13307,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You misunderstand the point of the video. As she said, she may not have the qualifications or skills to do anything else. But also, quitting her job wouldn&#39;t solve anything. She isn&#39;t saying the fashion industry is evil or to be avoided, she is saying that it is flawed, and by holding talks like this, spreading awareness of its issues, she is educating people and helping pave the way for future change. She also probably took the risk of losing her job by speaking so frankly, so I applaud her.",1
13308,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is very right on this issue and it seems that she is the only &quot;sexy girl&quot; white model that would point this out lol she let the secret out of the bag i guess? (though we know this wasn&#39;t a secret.),1
13309,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What? Lol, about no one who talks on TED is a communications major.",1
13310,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She said that she&#39;s not the person we see in the photo shoots, but she looks just as good standing on the stage to me.",1
13311,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It was all over the place because she was obviously nervous, she rushed her time, she doesn&#39;t speak for a living and she&#39;s only 25. TWENTY FIVE.

13314,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,check out my site ,1
13315,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,even though her delivery was all over the place i felt like she had good ideas and insightful things to say about self image and the fashion industry and the way society looks at racial prejudice. ,1
13316,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"exactly what i was thinking... it has a negative impact, yet she still contributes to it o_o... its like supporting a company that uses illegal or immoral business practices when you know its bad and want it to stop. largely negative things like this, in many cases, only have much power as the people supporting it give them, so why support them at all?",1
13317,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,dream on.,1
13318,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think that this has a bunch of views because it&#39;s a very good talk.,1
13319,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"and the pretty girls will always be assumed to be idiots/snobbish/self-centred/etc.. Sucks either way you slice it. We as human beings need to start putting in the effort required to actually assess people by who they are, rather than what they look like.",1
13320,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No. This talk was perfect. It all stems from her initial point - Image is powerful, but it&#39;s superficial. Image passes itself off as reality - and is often taken as reality from those on the outside looking in - but it often (usually) differs significantly from what actually pertains. Image is simple, reality is complex and textured. Image should therefore be questioned, and we should never therefore assume that it is what it claims to be. Because usually image is lying.  Excellent talk.",1
13321,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"that was sooo retarded.
she pretty much did that to boast fueled by her own insecuruties.

13323,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Overweight women only say this to make themselves feel better about being overweight. Theres a difference between being curvy, meaning your natural physique is curvy. Not because your overweight and try your best to hide it up with fashion techniques. I personally dont like thin girls, i like them tonnes and a little curvy. However, i cant stand overweight women who preach this shit. ",1
13324,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Please show me a picture of her partner and pictures of all the previous partners she&#39;s had. I guarantee you all were tall attractive males. Yet again, another woman who doesn&#39;t know what shes talking about. ",1

13328,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"money, duh",1
13329,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This comment made me so angry; I don&#39;t normally sign in to respond to any comments but I signed into my account for this one. Why should women give a fuck about what men like? Why are you even using this as a reason to help women stop starving themselves for the ideal image? How is this any different from telling women to stick their fingers down their throats and throw it all up because they&#39;ll look like models. MEN NEED TO STOP GIVING THEIR OPINIONS ON THE FEMALE BODY. ,1
13330,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is so model-ly.

13331,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very courageous and honest. Finally someone from the inside speaking honestly about what it&#39;s really like in the fashion industry.,1
13332,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Note to women aspiring to be &#39;thin&#39;; thin is not attractive or sexy. Slim can be but thin is a term used to describe a relative state, which is the opposite of thick or fat.

This model&#39;s figure is NOT what most men want in a woman and if they tell you that they do, it is because they have themselves been brainwashed by the same modelling/media industry.

Men, like women, want something to get their teeth into, not a bag of bones. It&#39;s a very bad example to set and isn&#39;t really healthy either.",1
13333,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That shit isn&#39;t easy to do. Imagine being working in one field for a long time then just dropping out expecting to get work in a totally different field most likely you won&#39;t be eating for a while,1

13337,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think Shereen&#39;s point is completely valid. If Cameron made these discoveries about the industry and herself, why would she then continue to contribute to and profit from this destructive culture rather than doing something to make a positive change within it?

13338,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is EXACTLY the discussion I had expected to be taking place here after watching the video. Everyone is arguing but no one seems to want to talk about the fact that once she made these discoveries she continued to model and doesn&#39;t mention at all becoming involved in implementing change within the industry or what she has done to help young girls and women improve their own self-image / self-esteem. I don&#39;t know why your comment was flagged as spam. It is not offensive at all. Thank you.

13341,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t EVERYTHING, but to have a supermodel who earns more in one shoot than a normal person earns in a year say that seems a little contoversial.

13358,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for your honesty...,1
13359,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Maybe they just want to be a model because of the work to pay ratio.,1

13361,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, I&#39;ve read that story. What do you mean by quoting it here?",1
13362,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That is what I was wondering. Is she speaking b/c the industry gets a bed rep and she wanted to make herself feel better? I don&#39;t know. Nevertheless, I liked the presentation and it did have a point. She raised interesting comments.",1

13366,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If we were talking about murder, you would have a point, but we&#39;re talking about liking pretty things, so you don&#39;t. No harm is done to society overall by not tormenting yourself for liking something you find attractive, the implication that you should feel bad for liking what you like is indeed a social construct. That you put murder in the same class as this only shows your lack of objectivity. Even in a baseline of beauty people still prefer their own preferences, nothing wrong with that",1
13367,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beauty with brain.,1
13368,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes,1

13372,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,do you actually know what ted talks is?,1
13373,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This whole thing is just dumb and elitist.  It&#39;s like some hollywood shit-bag with their shenanigans on global warming and then driving around in a SUV and flying in private jets.  ,1

13376,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That&#39;s because you buy into a phony social construct, it&#39;s not judging, it&#39;s hardwired into your lizard brain through evolution. It&#39;s not only what&#39;s helped mankind throughout the eons pick suitable partners that were free of defects/disease vulnerability, but it&#39;s also what keep Man (and many animal species) alive for other reasons. After all, there&#39;s a reason we don&#39;t find animals with fangs and aggressive predator features &quot;cute&quot;. ",1
13377,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think that this talk still has merit in directing attention to the silly ways we judge people based on looks.,1

Getting a pass on a speeding ticket isn&#39;t a social construct about beauty, evolution dictates we give beautiful things a pass.  Animals do the same thing in nature. As for suspicions, minorities commit more crimes, fact. BTW genetics determines intelligence for high skill professionals just the same as modeling, break the barrier with study is no different then break the model barrier with exercise. I hope you rethink your silly comment",1
13382,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well spoken! I was in a similar situation. It&#39;s hard to admit, but having a beautiful woman at my side WAS very powerful and validating to me, especially b/c as a young kid in school I was a shy nerd, and the &quot;hot&quot; girls seemed out of reach. So, having those hot girlfriends later in life was a way to prove myself.  But, as you said, when you are around someone who is preoccupied with anxiety and fear, it gets tiring. Unfortunately, all women (&amp; men) feel pressure to present a certain image :\",1
13383,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You seem condescending. Maybe that was not your intent, but I am sorry it is so.
No, she&#39;s not some PhD giving yet another talk. She could&#39;ve done better, clearly. But perhaps instead of insulting her as vacuous and phony you could listen. How being pretty helped her avoid tickets. How being white helps one avoid suspicion. She&#39;s trying to say that we make unfair judgments based on image, no? And I might not say being a doctor or other highly skilled pro is just genes. I hope you rethink this.",1

13387,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Is it ironic that one of the most vacuous talks delivered on this channel was delivered by a model?? There&#39;s nothing behind her rationale 1 be a model=the genetic lottery? No, truth is that the doctor ninja etc. she mentions also involves winning a genetic lottery, just a different kind. Also, there&#39;s no sexism/racism, the implication on that is that every race on Earth is racist for looking at something other than themselves. Just girl trying to alleviate her phony white liberal guilt, how sad",1
13388,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She didn&#39;t imply that everyone who wasn&#39;t a model doesn&#39;t understand. It sounds like she was just saying that she has the experience of a model, so she can relate to what Cameron Russell was saying.",1
13389,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Outstanding! I became a fan of TED and TEDx speeches just a few months ago and of the less than ten that I&#39;ve watched so far (and they all range from good to great), this presentation delivered a truly powerful message.",1
13390,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m not a model so apparently I don&#39;t understand.,1
13391,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m a model so I understand,1
13392,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,yeah yeah there are much better sites than youtube for girls. if you want the real shit this site has real girls nymphos who you can just message and they send you anything have a look at this: bit.ly/146SFEr?=tbjwi,1
13393,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I dated a beautiful woman &amp; she was the most insecure person I have ever known. she was a great person &amp; I loved her b/c of that, not her looks but she was ruled by fear... after 5 years she literally questioned me every day to test if I loved her as much as she loved me - her words - mentally exhausted, I had to leave the relationship. I have to admit that her appearance validated me on some level, if she were unattractive, the insecurity would&#39;ve driven me away in 6 weeks. Image affects us all",1
13394,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think she&#39;s far more attractive after having heard her speak. Pretty women don&#39;t do anything for me if they&#39;re uninteresting and shallow. Maybe this is the &#39;right&#39; thing to say but it&#39;s also the truth.,1
13395,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Again, you are proving her point aswell. She&#39;s making clear that a person&#39;s value is assumed by APPEARANCE. Not by who they are, but by what they look like. She&#39;s getting treated better because of what she looks like. 
So a anorexic looking person with skin revealing clothes is stupid and a whore according to you? Her fucking damn point.",1
13396,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"sorry, ran out of space to write. That&#39;s a really interesting point to make... I can&#39;t seem to grasp if it&#39;s bad or good. On one hand we are complimenting her beauty which is often seen as a good thing. Look at all the posts on fb about how a disabled child is still &#39;beautiful&#39;. Meaning when we call someone beautiful it must be good right? We are giving beauty importance, almost the role of a virtue. But on the other hand we are still judging them on appearance. I dunno, just wanted to say.",1
13397,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You can&#39;t judge by much more than that in a video. I think he/ she was just trying to compliment her. &quot;...I hope that we feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image...&quot; - her last line. In my opinion she is trying to say &#39;yeah we care about image... but we shouldn&#39;t let it rule our perception of someone&#39;. 

Oh, also I&#39;m not trying to argue. I just found it really interesting that a positive comment can be called a &#39;judgement&#39;. That&#39;s a really interesting point to make...",1
13398,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree, and in my opinion it didn&#39;t seem that she wanted sympathy, but to share some of her revelations that beauty can be only skin deep and that models aren&#39;t chosen because of their ability but simply because of the body type and face they were born with. Just my two cents.",1
13399,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,that was really and surprisingly  good.,1
13400,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Was that her point?  I figured a positive statement of opinion wasn&#39;t exactly what she was speaking against.  Now, if I&#39;d said she was a stupid anorexic whore because she was wearing a skimpy skin-tight number, that would make more sense.",1
13401,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,3:34 Major Burn,1
13402,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,fuck the movie,1
13403,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But she still makes a living out of this...,1
13404,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If she came up with that presentation on her own, she is brilliant!  In any case, she did an awesome job of translating focus from her outer beauty to her inner beauty.",1
13405,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,An honest speech but still difficult to sympathise.,1
13406,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"im surprised. dont waste time guys , rush to this site and get ur ipad3 or iphone as per ur choice. be mature and do this, your address and mail id is enough to receive ur ipad3. have a try and enjoy :)  ==&gt; bit.ly/140oAX4?=wqqsnl",1

By scouts who want them to loose a few more pounds or be an inch smaller somewhere.  To their face!",1
13409,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"her point exactly. You&#39;re judging her by appearance.

13412,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just seems wrong to make a career out of your looks then criticize the industry and at the source the people who pay you for it (us). But at the same time, who better? If any random person criticized it, they&#39;d typically get the &quot;you&#39;re jealous&quot; response.",1
13413,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you have a very strong personality, then you can get by without looks, but to regularly get positive attention in the average encounter between strangers, I&#39;ve found that you need looks, a great body, and assertive body language. Looks to success are on something like a logarithmic scale, which is why the average person holds doesn&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like to be invisible day in and day out.",1
13414,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The purpose is to point out how often we use image to define and judge others, often times in drastic forms like whether someone is guilty of a crime based on their race, or the way someone lives their life based on their body type. And, in realizing that we do this, we can hopefully take the extra steps to do something about it. I think a good starting point is to realize when we&#39;re making harsh judgments and take control of how we view people.

Although she looks nervous, insecure, unprofessional, and with a low power pose, she&#39;s a good source (speaker) because she represents her topic, which is great, she has an awesome point, she can easily &quot;read&quot; her receivers (audience), she&#39;s employing the Five Canons of Rhetoric very well (in my opinion), and yes, she&#39;s beautiful!

13430,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I hear what you&#39;re saying but at least she&#39;s talking about these things.

13433,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i also disagree. she gave a very effective, reflective speech. i&#39;m sorry that you can&#39;t see the beauty of it because you&#39;re busy judging her &quot;nervousness&quot;. 
",1
13434,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t really agree, because a focal point of her talk was that even the seemingly beautiful and confident models are insecure, and her nervousness could very well be a reflection of that. If she stood up with a contrived sense of confidence and spoke about her insecurity, then it would appear disingenuous. It was an honest, and true speech. Her being nervous made it that much more poignant.",1

I know 4 and they don&#39;t.",1
13438,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"exactly, it&#39;s 2+2 equals 4, just think about a woman THAT beautiful telling a group of viewers that super models like her are &quot;probably the most self conscious&quot; of the world&#39;s people...it&#39;s a great script-flipper, and not what you&#39;d expect...but it&#39;s not reality, it&#39;s like saying Donald Trump is the cheapest guy in the world...ugly girls out there watching this are like &quot;bitch, what exactly do YOU have to be self-conscious about??&quot; You&#39;re a TEN!&quot; it&#39;s easy to believe hot women&#39;s words, but THINK",1

13467,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t want to burst your bubble and I&#39;m sure that some of what you say about police profiling is true, but numbers don&#39;t lie. 76% of the 513 shooting deaths in 2012 in Chicago were due to black on black crime. That number is not the result of profiling. A better argument would be that there are more economic challenges in the black community and that can be a major factor in the crime rate.",1

What ticks me off is that she would stand their and answer these stupid ass questions that we all know the answer to. How do you become a model?? Uhh, look hotter then everybody else. can I become a model? her answer is why? Really if you look like that why wouldn&#39;t you. You have the best of both worlds you can do whatever you want and look good doing it.",1

How often do we see people who enjoy easy success express shame, guilt, and self loathing??  How does this help those who didn&#39;t win the genetic lottery?  You will never be a supermodel and I will never play in the NFL.  Is victimization better than racism?",1

13479,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"you&#39;re obviously right. models do have at least enough self esteem to share 20 selfies on instagram every day, go to parties and pick up good looking man with whom they have hot sizzling sex.

13484,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"but I see your point, Super Models like Heidi Klume and Naomi Campbell ARE very insecure, but they have not died over it..and they still go to parties and live normal celebrity lives with millions of dollars and any man they want....millions of girls, especially young ones, are WAY more insecure to the point that they kill themselves because they&#39;re not even close to Heidi Klume, THEY are probably the most insecure women in the world.   that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying, but you&#39;re right.",1
13485,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think you misunderstood me, you put the word &quot;some&quot; in there as in &quot;some of the most insecure people in the world&quot; and I&#39;m totally on side.  I lose her when she says that Super Models are &quot;probably the most insecure&quot; in the world...I realize there are fewer super models out there than normal girls...most of the deaths by suicide and fatal eating disorders are NOT happening to world-famous super models, they are happening to normal girls, or, to aspiring models, not super models or famous folks",1
13486,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"no doubt at all Super models are very self-conscious...but the most in the world?  How many famous super models commit suicide out of disgust in themselves? Some certainly, but as many as girls who are not super models? of course not.  It&#39;s like when Opera says being a mother is &quot;the most difficult job on the planet&quot;, she doesn&#39;t really believe that ALL the planet&#39;s mothers struggle more with their children than coal miners or crab fisherman or sweat-shop slaves. It&#39;s a figure of speech..I hope.",1
13487,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s true what you bring up about other cultures...in pau pau new guinea for example, large, short, heavy women are considered beautiful.  In China, the fairest, most petite, even undersized women were regarded as their goddesses since before the Ming dynasty...We all are hard-wired AND socially conditioned to desire different shapes and sizes, some of which happen to fit pretty closely with the babes of today. In Germany, thin, tall women were always regarded as beautiful, not so in Ghana. ",1
13488,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Believing that our (men&#39;s) loins jump into primal throws of eroticism and instinctive need to fornicate when we see a trim woman with large breasts and a round butt due ENTIRELY to social conditioning and IN NO WAY AT ALL to physiological preference from natural selection is arguable.  It&#39;s not always a black or white answer with these things, we are conditioned to be attracted to exaggerated versions of what our reproductive organs naturally desire. It&#39;s both nature and nurture.  ",1
13489,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t know how to answer your question, the proposition that what a lot of westerners do is healthier never crossed my mind, I&#39;m as hard pressed to believe it as you are. Our collective (and I do mean virtually every culture in the developed world) idea of beauty is mostly generated by nurture, but where does that stem from? Helen of Troy was 5&#39; 10&quot;, very tall for the time, busty, shapely, yet under 140 lbs...she was the most beautiful woman in history, she is basically the Kate Upton of Rome.",1
13490,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Um, no? If you did some research, you would know that our idea of a beautiful body is not something we are designed to find attractive - it&#39;s called social conditioning, or brainwashing. You might want to look at the past (just a few dacades prior) or other cultures to figure that out. 
Read the article Forced to Be Fat by Marie Claire for a country where western beauty standards are completely reversed - not endorsing force feeding, but how is what lot of westerners do any healthier? ",1

I&#39;m sure she does philanthropy work (as all celebrities do) but she doesn&#39;t talk about what she&#39;s doing to fight or bring awareness to this whole twisted media&#39;s obsession of &quot;beauty.&quot; By continuing to be plastered on magazines? I doubt it. ",1

I saw one models booker pinching her sides w/disgust. Now im beyond this, but it took me a while. I still overhear models picking themselves apart in the mirror &#39;maybe if my skin were better, or I worked more on this, or my (insert body part here) was in better shape. It tears me up so I try to build their esteem every chance I get. Things are rarely as they seem.",1
13495,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Actually, sorry to break it to you, but models are some of the most insecure people I&#39;ve ever met. Try to put your preconceived notions aside and imagine, just for a minute that your livelihood, sense of &quot;worth&quot;, visibility and career depended solely on your looks. A typical day means being scrutinized by people who have your job in their hands, comparing you to worldwide images of perfection, while holding your portfolio full of photoshopped pix of yourself that you dont even measure up to",1

I feel like the idealism in this presentation is circumventing listener&#39;s abilities to think critically about the reality of the things she is flipantly implying...just my opinion, but I think I&#39;m right about this ",1

Firstly that once you&#39;ve been a model for ten years, and you decide you want to be president or something, people look at you funny, and secondly, that she is insecure.

13556,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yeah so why arent I her if shes playing smart? if she hates her life she could give it to me, im stuck here :(((",1
13557,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Interesting,  the only thing I can take from this is nobody is happy. Shes says being beautiful isn&#39;t always easy but I wonder if she realizes the true extent of her privilege? Im not sayings beautiful people dont have problems but it seems like she wants her cake and eat it too. Try being ugly or poor are ethnic or all of these things. There is nothing free in life for you then.",1

A friend of mine was once at a party, talking with a guy from an affluent background. 
He asked where my friend went to school, my friend named his high school, which was a public school system.

He looked surprised and said &quot;You speak very well for going to a public school.&quot; And my friend thanked him.

Later, my friend realized what he was really saying, &quot;It surprised me that you are as educated as I am, and yet from a public school.&quot;",1

Please open your mind to your statements before speaking them... I&#39;m not mad or upset with you, just trying to have a conversation about your impression of others based of their status and looks... just like what the topic of this talk elaborates on.

In the visual medium the evidence of how draining and insecure a business it is should be readily apparent from the start.

It&#39;s not just that she&#39;s beautiful (defined by &quot;health, youth and symmetry&quot; as she says), but also that she fits today&#39;s society&#39;s ideals and looks like what society wants to put in their magazines and billboards: she&#39;s white, tall and thin. That&#39;s the &quot;legacy&quot;.

Jeeze I think my children are beautiful too but would never ever think that would limit them so I focus on their intellectual strengths.  Get a grip.",1
13605,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,No I don&#39;t think so. It&#39;s unlikely a police officer would know who she was; it&#39;s probably also not the case that the store owner/worker knew who she was.

13615,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s not really her looks that get her everything she wants in life. It is her TITLE. Her looks, along with some luck, just opened the barrier to entrance in the modeling industry. The power of suggestion that someone is a model automatically makes people think that they are somehow above everyone else. Beauty is diverse, though.

13632,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"True, but having the message come from the horse&#39;s mouth demystifies the cohesively perpetuated image of beauty and its relation to worth (or her by her terminology, legacy).

Mean spirited towards her because of her (unearned, which she acknowledged) outward appearance.

Things that are only manly (technology, science, etc) because they do not revolve around being nothing more than a sex object (shoes, fashion).

The thing that we all know to be true, is that we make assumptions about people by the visual clues they give us - it&#39;s a part of our nature.

There are studies which show how white people actually lack empathy for those of different races inherently - as an example, how many times do you hear an Asian musician described as &quot;not playing with emotion&quot;? There are other subconscious race-based prejudices we hold as well, as she shows with the statistics about blacks being pulled over. I wonder how other standards of beauty could appear.",1

Yes, the white models make up most of the percentage but that doesn&#39;t prove anything. In white majority societies you&#39;d expect mostly white models; that&#39;s a logical conclusion.
If you were to reverse her reasoning and go to South Korea, you wouldn&#39;t state &quot;Well since most models here are of Asian ethnicity; it would seem like we&#39;d describe beauty as yellow skin, short and thin.&quot; 
And she mentions a PhD just cause he counted the # of models...
what?",1
13674,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the best part about this is that the media says that pictures of models, make other people insecure about their own body image, the funny thing about that is when i see skinny models on posters I don&#39;t think oh she&#39;s skinny and attractive, I think oh god she looks skinny and hungry think I&#39;m going to eat a pie today.",1
13675,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i know,1

",1
13677,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This talk was great. She really touched on a lot of points that dont get brought up enough. ,1
13678,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That&#39;s not the overall message here. What she tried to do was make a point about appearances vs reality. The appearance being her seemingly glamorous profession and a deeply misconstrued notion among young girls that beauty leads to happiness. While she emphasizes that her looks have made life a little easier at times, she downright ridicules her profession. And then she gives social commentary about how even as a model, she falls victim to the extreme beauty ideals made by our society.",1
13679,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i&#39;m a model and I completely understand.,1
13680,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think she looks so much better in the natural pictures and is much prettier when she&#39;s a natural.,1
13681,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,nice,1
13682,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she&#39;s just keeping it real.  Nothing wrong with it - nor is anything intrinsically wrong with being a model.  Recognizing the stuff in your own profession isn&#39;t new or bad.  People point out stuff in professional athletics.  Are they also just justifying what they do, even though a lot of them are incredibly rich?  If you are going to use that argument, which may be true, it has to be used unilaterally.",1
13683,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;How do you enjoy life when you&#39;re constantly consumed in how you look and you feel your looks validate you as a person.&quot; by enjoying the fact that even though you&#39;re not as cute as you would like, you&#39;re still cuter than almost everyone else. theres nothing worse than a cute girl down talking beauty lol. beauty is a form of genius. &quot;you smile, oh but when you&#39;ve lost it, it will be no time to smile.&quot; -lord henry ",1

13685,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hear hear!,1
13686,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"How else was she supposed to point out this incredible obsession we have with  superficiality, in which people like her, models, are glorified for what isn&#39;t even original, untouched &quot;beauty&quot;?
I don&#39;t know what you heard, but I heard some deep criticism of this industry of exploitation and pop-culture manufacturing.

People:
Stop worrying about your physical appearance and worry more about what kind of character shines through. And money? If you have your physical needs met, you&#39;ll be fine!",1
13687,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I find is AMAZING that TED hosted this and also this about how to use seduction to get what you want . . . youtube.com/watch?v=TBIL2sdfoVc,1
13688,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think she hit the nail on the head when she said that models are physically the most insecure women on the planet. When your entire worth is based off how you look then any little imperfection will bring you down ten times more than the regular woman. How do you enjoy life when you&#39;re constantly consumed in how you look and you feel your looks validate you as a person. Many models are extremely egocentric but that is often to cover up their insecurity.,1
13689,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she ought to get impaled by Lex Steele,1

13693,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow i learnt alot.,1
13694,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Halfway through her talk she was trying to convince us that she&#39;s not all that attractive. HA!,1
13695,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah. It sucks when people dismiss you based on your looks before actually figuring out what you have to say.,1
13696,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think it&#39;s more about how the images we have of beautiful people are constructions, not truths, and that living that life isn&#39;t as perfect as it appears. We all want perfect bodies and the like, but she wants to tell us that there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Also, she highlights the racism of our current perception of beauty. These points are interesting and valid, in my opinion.",1
13697,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You know nothing, Zak Taylor.",1
13698,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I did respond to him.  I was just adding that not only is an addiction to porn harmful, but porn in and of itself is harmful, in part, because of what you said, it perpetuates lies, about men, women, sex and relationships.  I have a problem with the idea of casual sex and casual porn use because both devalue people.",1
13699,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Try telling that to HomePersonalSecurity!
I have the biggest problem with porn with the  lies it perpetuates, both in the industry, and the viewers who know nothing about how it was produced. It doesn&#39;t have to be like that, but it is mostly like that. ",1
13700,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That may be what our culture teaches, and what your life experiences have reinforced, but many men are offended by such definitions of what it means to be a man.  Sexual desire doesn&#39;t automatically result in objectifying and using women.  You have a choice.    ",1

13704,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think there is some truth to that...she does sound conflicted.  I hope the best for her.  I didn&#39;t hear her say how she changed as a model, in becoming more discerning in the jobs she takes-on, the people she works for etc.",1
13705,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She does sound like she is conflicted, but it sounds like she&#39;s responding to what she knows is true, so far.  There was some lack of clarity because she didn&#39;t really say what she thought was right/wrong about how the industry works.  I wonder if she does want to become her own boss and transform the fashion industry in some way. ",1
13706,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;She said herself she has no power.&quot;  Did she say that?  I do think that she may be learning herself what makes her valuable as a woman and what power she does have.  &quot;...she has benefitted by her socially privileged position, but so have all you white Americans!&quot;  Huh?",1
13707,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People are different.  Every person is different.  In more ways than we will ever know until we learn to appreciate the differences in ourselves and the people in our lives.  I&#39;ve been thinking about this.  Do I appreciate that I&#39;m different?  The differences in my family and freinds?  Why do we want to put people in boxes and group people?  How is this helpful?  How is this not helpful?,1
13708,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why?,1
13709,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Lust is ugly.  Women struggle with it too, both sexually and in other ways that is hurtful to people.  And lust prevents people from seeing themselves and others in healthy ways.

13711,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;What the fashion industry sells is a type of beauty that is rare.&quot;  I think Cameron Russell was saying that the fashion industry sells more than a &quot;type of beauty&quot;, it&#39;s a manufactured beauty (listed the professionals involved).  In other words, it&#39;s not natural, like Superman is not a natural man.  So, they are selling an &quot;ideal(s)&quot;.  An unattainable ideal(s).  It makes me ask, what are those ideals, and are they best and therefore good to pursue?",1
13712,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"And then you die.  

I don&#39;t think Cassandra is arguing that a person&#39;s looks don&#39;t matter.  She said that physical beauty is less important then many people think.  Do we need to match a certain image as men and woman in order to live a full life?  Will aspiring to or attaining an image secure for us a full life?",1
13713,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am having a hard time getting past the image of your posting name &quot;murdr&quot;, speaking of looks mattering.  I don&#39;t agree with &quot;animal instincts&quot;.  I do agree that it&#39;s a modern idea that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  However, is beauty skin deep?   What role does our culture and individual predispositions play?  What if beauty includes goodness and truth?  Like in Cassandra&#39;s post, a happy grandma is more beautiful in appearance than a sad one.  ",1
13714,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think her speech did make her vulnerable to judgement.  She gave us a take-away...to think about/acknowledge/experience the power of &quot;image&quot;, and how we can perceive someone/ourselves as successful or not based on  image alone.  I don&#39;t think the talk was about justifying a career choice or not.  Although, I would be interested in hearing why she has chosen to continue to be a model and if she had a do-over, if she would have chosen a different path.   ",1

13718,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If she is serous about what she said &quot;that is not me&quot; then quit your fucking job and do something else! She went to college and is well spoken now so QUIT OR STFU. But sure you don&#39;t because it&#39;s so great to get everything for free isn&#39;t it? And yeah I am jealous because I want to have a easy life like this as well - see I can be honest as well. Just STFU and look sexy but don&#39;t start to tell us how unfair and had it&#39;s for us if you continue causing the problem! Now go down-vote me sheeples.,1

Heck, the media is so powerful in instilling this image that beauty trends around the world are changing.",1

Also, when you have looks (she didn&#39;t state it that way because it would probably receive a negative feedback,but this is probably what she meant), everything becomes superficial because you&#39;re not sure whether you&#39;re liked for just your looks or for the person you are.",1

There have been many studies done demonstrating that, when doing and saying the EXACT SAME THINGS to the EXACT SAME PEOPLE, better-looking people appear more confident, more open, nicer, and more receptive. Looks ARE important. If a good-looking dude says something stupid, people laugh. If an ugly dude does, they&#39;re just weird and awkward.

13779,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,",loved it.. really inspired me.. ",1
13780,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,so much more attractive in the dress down,1
13781,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Check out my video my channel is Jazmine McCain it&#39;s similar to this,1
13782,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,well done,1
13783,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the truth hurts... how can we get to the core of who we are, if we do not speak and ask the truth of ourselves and others.",1
13784,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So just because she isn&#39;t as *studious* and *naturally* gifted as Bill Gates is in studies makes her undeserving to tell and enlighten others of the dangers of preconstructed images in society? Even though she has personal experiences with it? Um. Also, she had even said that her modeling job pays for her education in college, and based on a little more research *googling* she is getting/has gotten a degree in economics and *social sciences.*",1
13785,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People don&#39;t care and want to continue the cycle of preconceived notions based on appearance or dwell on their insecurities based on how threatening this woman is to this ideal in our superficial societies.,1
13786,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I know and its sad that people (including me) are surprised when a beautiful woman comes up and says something meaningful. Just goes to show how we preconceive so much about a person just on how they look. ,1
13787,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I wonder how much she&#39;s getting paid for that appearance?
",1
13788,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hmm ,  I just find it so &quot;touching&quot; when white people own up to their privilege ...",1
13789,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Who you really are is a complex question or rather the answer is complex. Some people are born geniuses, also an unearned quality. 

Tel me people...what part of you is who your really are?",1
13790,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I suppose you&#39;r a man ? For someone who watch &quot;all&quot; of TED videos, i found your argument very disapointing. You do realize that, if you aim the correct population, this video can change a mind ? You do realize that mankind can also be changed by starting to talk to a single individual ? Also, you wont find all the answers in education or science. Your way of viewing TED videos is superficial and inefficient.",1
13791,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she eventually got sick from throwing up all day and sleeping with photographers.,1
13792,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is honest , I will give her that. ",1
13793,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not sure if i got the point.... i started masturbating 20 seconds into the presentation,1
13794,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Bill Gates has continued his education through video and text composed by men with stronger pedagogy than even his former Harvard professors. You aren&#39;t following his logic, you&#39;re just appear to by omitting the details of your example that make it an entirely different circumstance. Also the presenter emphasized that she has spent her life cashing in on a genetic lotttery, which has therefore missed out on some personal development. By that logic, NBA players are inferior to professors.",1
13795,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I have a degree. So by his logic, I should be doing a Ted talk. :)

Well, if they want me.... I&#39;m game. :)",1
13796,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is YouTube the internet service whose catchnet of users falls into a  category of people for whom writing poisonous remarks about other random people. About how they look, spell, think, etc, frequently rises to the top of the list of things they are capable of thinking of doing. Think about it when you read comments like that: They could not think of anything better to do with that moment of their lives than that. They indict themselves by, aggressively as they can, trying to indict others.",1

13798,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Another &quot;born again.&quot;...I did it this way, made my bucks but it was wrong. I should&#39;ve
but the money is always nice.",1
13799,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If anything, TED talk is about inspiring people and not condemning them for trying to inspire others. Saying she doesn&#39;t deserve a spot on TED is like saying the NBA players are inferior to any college professors. Also, did you know that Bill Gates is also on TEDtalk? He is a college dropout and probably deserve nobody&#39;s respect, according to this logic",1
13800,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Irony: this vid has so many views mainly because of the thumbnail.,1
13801,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She presented a refreshing take on the fashion industry, especially where ethnicity is concerned.  I&#39;m Scandinavian, English and Irish and am classified as a &quot;racially ambiguous&quot; model...I&#39;m technically about as white as you get but am booked for more exotic shoots because of how I&#39;m perceived.  To support Cameron, it&#39;s an odd experience modelling and having people talk around you as if you&#39;re a prop, commenting on your body/face like you can&#39;t hear (and it&#39;s not always positive critiquing).",1
13802,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Big deal, society makes pretty girls feel like shit for being pretty because they&#39;re not, and as a result pretty chicks are insecure &amp; then society fake reacts like they care when models like this speak on how average/below average majority makes them feel.

Not much of a revelation, we all know this. ",1
13803,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"perceived my ass, she&#39;s hot",1
13804,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great talk. Every school girl needs to see this. ,1
13805,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I agree with you. I thought her speech was very revealing about what goes on behind the cameras and what models actually think about themselves. ,1
13806,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Teenage girls are insecure about themselves? REVOLUTIONARY!,1
13807,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"millions  of girls  want the &quot;&quot;misery&quot;&quot; that she is going througt



",1
13808,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Nah. TED talks are all about ideas. You don&#39;t have to have a degree to have a valuable idea. I feel this idea was important, and worth saying, and she just happened to be the person with the intelligence and experience to properly explain it. In this, it is a perfect TED talk. ",1
13809,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I respect it ! &lt;3 ,1
13810,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;you could be inventor of the next internet&quot; ......
",1
13811,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow so many haters. I always heard the rap guys talk about haters but I always thought you know, who is a hater? I never thought they actually existed. They were fairy tales, cool guy fantasies invented to generate hype. But now I have had a revelation of sorts, and I realize they are everywhere. She is just a women, giving her experience and perspective on her career. Why should we hate her for that? Personally I think she did a brave thing calling out the industry she works for. ",1
13812,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just as blacks and Hispanics can walk down the trailer park and not have the thought of getting assaulted going through their heads. Also, I lived around some of those dark alleys for 10 years, you won&#39;t be getting raped so don&#39;t worry. Robbed maybe, but not raped. And usually if you give them what they want, they go away. Because they do not hate you, it&#39;s a money thing. And they will never target you because of your skin color. ",1
13813,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this is a huge message to all the girls that are throwing up and starving themselves and the boy destroying their bodies training because they think being skinny with make them happy.,1
13814,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,well I&#39;m a white man and I&#39;m glad because i can walk down a dark alley with out the idea of getting raped going through my head.,1
13815,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you felt like she didn&#39;t say anything, LOOK UP, because it&#39;s entirely possible that you&#39;ll see something important flying right over your head.",1
13816,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Seems like the title of the vid and the message of the talk are quite antithetical. ,1
13817,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hearing her talk makes me wish I was an Ebola virus. ,1
13818,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you are looking to get ripped, you should look up on Google &quot;H6x Muscle Monster&quot;. You are bound to get the body you deserve.",1

",1
13820,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Even though alot of people talk about the lack of substance she held on this talk I think she did a fantastic job because their is so much many to the modeling industry that its hard to just talk about one aspect without branching out and discussing others. Sure her talk was a bit scattered but it seemed like her first time, that and shes a model, I don&#39;t they get many opportunities to express their intellectual thoughts freely, so I am commending her for her honesty and information.",1
13821,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is every insecure guy&#39;s worst nightmare,... Physically beautiful in every measure as well as articulate, and delivers a potent message... if your not so confident about your size,... she will make you feel tiny.",1
13822,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s not about the ums, it&#39;s not about anything but taking what she is saying in a way that inspires you personally. This can be one word, a sentence, or the entire video. We have to look beyond! 
",1
13823,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wasnt that about the time she started covering up her skimpy dress :P,1
13824,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Her point has to be concluded in exactly this fashion.

She presented a talk, in which no idea was shared, which people have bitched about in the comments... however she has 700k views and is way in the green when it comes to likes.",1
13825,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok I take it back she&#39;s cool.
",1
13826,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I like this. its easy to believe that models have amazing lives but honestly i would hate to be judged on my looks alone. also the fact that she did a photoshoot in a bikini before she had even had her first period was so shocking, really says something about the fashion industry",1
13827,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This had absolutely no concept. ,1
13828,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;...the difference of [whether] you go...&quot; Sorry, had to.",1
13829,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I completely agree, she gave her background basically, and the REAL lives of models and the shady parts of the world where looks can be the difference of weather you go to jail or not despite living in the 20th century.  To me her speech is telling the story behind the curtain of the constant stress models, and many other women, go through. Imagine if you had to spend every moment worrying about how you look, even in this short speech she shows several signs of it. So it comes with a catch ",1
13830,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"30 seconds in I already don&#39;t like this. 
",1
13831,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Did you watch that talk at all?,1
13832,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not bad,1
13833,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,shes hot,1
13834,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i guess what you said is true... but you try going up there and trying to make some great moving intelligent speech in front of a bunch of people. not very easy huh. and even though necessarily she didnt give us substance as you say, we can still take something from what shes given us",1
13835,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you&#39;re talking/thinking about her, rather than trying to find any broad takeaway insight, then you&#39;re wasting your time. If a non-model came up and talked about the industry would that help, or would you just fixate on their &#39;ugliness&#39; and bitterness about it?

This isn&#39;t directed at anyone in particular, but to the empty stream of ad hominem comments",1
13836,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,agreed,1
13837,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah I thought she was brilliant!!,1
13838,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Whole thing seems like one big humble brag,1
13839,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"very good insight into the model&#39;s thinking
she is not bimbo !",1
13840,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is what happens when we let encourage &#39;pretty white women&#39; to think and vocalise. Just give it a fucking rest, you&#39;re hot we get it. You&#39;ve won the genetic lottery for &#39;pretty&#39;, you haven&#39;t for intellectual or insightful so just zip it. TED: THE SHORTCUT TO ENLIGHTENMENT. But not really.",1
13841,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I can&#39;t take you seriously with the troll face pic. XD,1
13842,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I thought that was a brilliant and honest talk. It seems people forget she was given this world of fickle vanity she did not make it so yeah she did Benoit from her looks but wouldn&#39;t most people if they had that opportunity.,1
13843,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I believe she knows exactly how privileged she is, and THAT was the subject of her talk.  Yet even as she benefits and is rewarded for her perceived beauty, she is exploited by that same industry and her value is reduced to her mere external appearance.",1
13844,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I believe she said she paid her way through college by modelling.  I thought she was very well-spoken.  Man, you all are so hard on her!",1
13845,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"SHE is not the reason American girls hate themselves.  She is just a model.  She said herself she has no power.  It is fashion editors and the advertising industry who hire models like her who perpetuate beauty fascism.  This woman has had the insight to deconstruct the industry of which she is a part.  And yes, she has benefitted by her socially privileged position, but so have all you white Americans!",1
13846,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is not exactly &quot;the reason&quot; but she is definitely a contributing factor.  The actual reason is that image sells and that leads to an entire industry dedicated to creating images.  Just look at the political parties in America today.  They are 100% image and zero substance.  Ultimately, we, the people, are responsible for why little girls hate themselves today.  We buy the rubbish the images promote.",1
13847,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"really? i heard more remorse than hypocrisy.like a big ol&#39; &quot;this is what happens, i am a part of it and I&#39;m not so glad i&#39;m a part of it&quot; maybe i&#39;m misunderstanding",1
13848,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she&#39;s the reason why american girls hate themselves, ironic how she&#39;s the cause of her talk. kinda like saddam giving a ted talk on world peace and racial equality",1
13849,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is like White Man saying there is no such thing as male privilege. LOL She has no idea how much benefit she has over others.,1
13850,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Amen,1
13851,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"why do you want to be a model, why not be a teacher, a doctor etc. She actually says that?  I dont know about you but having a great body is the easiest way to get what you want. I can be a doctor AND a model. Ofc modeling isnt my full time job and i wouldnt exploit it a much as you do, but modeling is also temporary. I would much rather get a phd and have modeling as a backup when the money gets low. and believe me. it gets very low. and yes i am jealous of her beauty and i wish i had it too.",1
13852,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is stupid. I&#39;m disappointed in her speech and TED&#39;s choice of the speaker,1
13853,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t think you have seen many TED talks...,1
13854,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So many people judging! I believe we should learn and listen the good things someone has to say without expecting that person to be perfect in eeeverything they do or say. ,1
13855,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Shhhh.,1
13856,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Liberal White guilt on display. She could always stop modeling or give the money to black women...didn&#39;t think so.,1
13857,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah but she still perpetuates all the negative things she partakes in. ,1
13858,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"why only women are treated as sexual objects, and sexy is all about ur genetic lottery and dont u think there is miss representation of women in this industry, what some people say this media industry is controlled by men, funded by men......",1
13859,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"cameron u luk better in this dress what u r wearing on TED stage......u r ri8, image is superficial......u r not wat u showcase in ur modeling career, and yes u ri8, u can better be president, doctor, or do sumthng like tht, serve society.......why only women are treated as sexual objects, and sexy is all about ur genetic lottery and dont u think there is miss representation of women in this industry, what some people say this media industry is controlled by men, funded by men......",1
13860,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yes, that is the whole point of her presentation",1
13861,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,give me a wife like that!,1
13862,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I grew up with a model in the family and she always said stuff like this. She never wears expensive clothes, but always looks presentable and is pleasant.",1
13863,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I feel like I was sermoned by a priest, titties!",1
13864,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"quite amazing.
",1
13865,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree with you. She didn&#39;t hit any strong points or have a convincing, revealing closing point but it may be due to the short time she was allocated.",1
13866,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,if she was ugly she wouldn&#39;t be on ted talks. ,1
13867,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"titties
",1
13868,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, but we all know that. I completely agree with her, it&#39;s just nothing new. I&#39;ll admit I haven&#39;t watched every TED speech, but I usually find them motivational, inspiring, or at least interesting. This one was just lacking.",1
13869,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very meaningful.,1
13870,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You shouldn&#39; expect a talk like this to reach a &#39;conclusion&#39;. The issues she talks about are on-going and are definitely still prevalent. Yes it&#39;s an introduction, and one which is meant to encourage further discussion rather than offer an all-encompassing or satisfying means to an end",1
13871,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,hear hear,1
13872,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"@Gmmaverick, Thank you. ",1
13873,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not all men use porn. &#39;Addiction&#39; in this context is someone who is using porn to the extent that it is negatively impacting on other aspects of their lives. Therefore it is not BS, as this is a reality for many. ",1
13874,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I do not think she is complaining. ,1
13875,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Finally, THANK YOU! ",1
13876,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think you missed the point. ,1
13877,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,#hotgirlproblems,1
13878,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Naw mate, human nature is good. Beauty is a mark of awesomeness, but if you abuse that gift you lose your awesomeness. Just trust your instincts",1
13879,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"its also human nature to think and give respect and compassion, yet many &#39;people&#39; seem to lack that greatly. ",1
13880,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,if you&#39;re commenting things along the line of  &#39;not only is she beautiful but she can actually conceive mediocrely intellectual thoughts by god I am so impressed!&#39; then you missed the whole point of this talk! she has spent 10 years in an industry that scrutinized and criticizes and actually makes someone believe they are nothing more than the exterior of their bodies that they have zero control over. and she is actually saying something about it. stop doing exactly what this whole talk is about,1
13881,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Finally someone from the modeling industry speaks the truth of what most perceives as beauty. She may not be the most awe-inspiring speaker but from her tone it feels genuine.  ,1
13882,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I guess, but does give us a insight into her world and her views and understandings. Have you watched the video &quot;To This Day Project - Shane Koyczan&quot;, because that video is truly inspirational! :) ",1
13883,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are amazing! You are a true angel from the inside to your outside. My best wishes to you! YOU ARE REAL!,1
13884,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is saying do not aspire to be a model. &quot;Be my boss&quot; ! Modeling is to superficial and mostly built up &quot;image&quot;. Aspire wor a &quot;real&quot; career.,1
13885,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"not only is she beautiful, she is also eloquent :) ",1
13886,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You look better in person, or at-least sexier.",1
13887,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wished she talked more about a discriminated story &#39;shes&#39; experienced or seen.,1
13888,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This makes me think of all the horrible movies that were made and how people only watched them because the actors were physically attractive.,1
13889,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Who cares what she says, she is cute and looks great. ie. is that you in your little icon? if so, let me pay you a compliment, you look great too!",1
13890,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t think it is meant to be new or interesting, especially not inspirational. It&#39;s more about awareness and to actually see the point of view of someone in her position. I understand not seeing the point, but it is there.",1
13891,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A very honest and open speech which nails it on the head. I think she has made a great deal of good points.
",1
13892,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Again, what I meant to say is that there&#39;s nothing new, interesting or inspiring about this presentation in my opinion.",1
13893,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Dho! If you are pretty and sexy and an officer stops you, he will let you go free of any charge, if look at him, smile and sweetly say; &quot; I am sorry officer&quot;, because you made his day. And we all man would do the same, Capiche?",1
13894,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,SAYS the hot one. ,1
13895,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Really did she just u have to have white skin,1
13896,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she is inspiring I think she is amazing,1
13897,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Maybe you are not thinking deeply enough about what she is saying? Did you understand it?,1
13898,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was one of the best things I have seen on youtube.,1
13899,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I probably should&#39;ve rephrased that. What I meant is.. what&#39;s new? There&#39;s nothing interesting or inspiring about this presentation IMHO.,1
13900,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It was secretly just a really long advertisement for the clothes she was wearing.,1
13901,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,really?,1
13902,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Image is powerful.&quot;  Well, sexual power is huge for good looking women.  For guys, well, they have to become financially successful through earnings to obtain power.  Now watch what happens as time passes.  Looks fade and wealth builds.  Why do teenage girls not like their bodies?  Because they sense how valuable and powerful beauty is.  Well, at least for a while.  Kind of interesting I think.",1
13903,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m only watching this because she is hot. Looks are everything.,1
13904,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Have you examined the neuroscience at all, ever? &quot;This &quot;addicted to porn&quot; thing is just total bullshit.&quot; Apparently not.",1
13905,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s visual for both sexes, at least biologically. The difference is that pretty much all commercial porn is made for and sold to men, you know, because sexism.",1
13906,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good video, I think it was cut short though, didnt she say there would be other clothing changes",1
13907,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&gt;&gt; people get addicted to porn because  . . . 

It&#39;s called being &quot;male&quot;. It gets crowed in there and must be let out.
This &quot;addicted to porn&quot; thing is just total bullshit. Man gets hungry, he eats, tired, he sleeps, horny, has sex or whacks off to images, . . because with men, it&#39;s mostly visual. 
",1
13908,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"agree. Plus &quot;beauty&quot; is defined by Madison Ave and Photoshop.
",1
13909,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"blah blah blah . . , no shit, . . Madison Ave advertising is all bullshit.

The only way to &quot;stop this&quot; is turn away and turn off Mainstream Media.
But this is never going to stop.
Girls who have looks as assets are going to use them. End of story.
She&#39;s not saying anything new or enlightening, or is going to change anything. We live in an false image based society. Most people are judged by looks. Hopefully people figure this stupid game out and dont&#39; buy into it. I never did.
",1
13910,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It is her analysis on the modelling industry and her part in it. It is very subjective, there is some advice in there too, and I think on the whole it is very informative and interesting.",1
13911,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People who suffer abuse for the way they look still find fulfilling relationships. I cannot speak for them, but I doubt that they want good looks above everything else. Good looks are very much like money and possessions - easily lost,lacking in true fulfillment. 
The speech is mainly directed at those who wish to enter modelling; it is not  meant to be a definitive comment on whether looks are the be all and end all or not. ",1
13912,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"However, some extremely good looking people ARE in high powered jobs. I knew a man who modelled, and then became a doctor. My radiologist is extremely attractive, Brian Cox is a well known English physicist who is also a cutie!",1
13913,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I guess the money can compensate a lot of the crap, and it must be a BIT glamourous at times!",1
13914,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Put very well. ,1
13915,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"As we do not have the same chances in life I would suggest that this tells us clearly that we are NOT equal. Some inequalities can and have been addressed with legislation, but we can never change the biases of looks, height, hair colour (gingerism), and the many other inequalities based on our physical appearance. ",1
13916,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"mozsey said &#39;seemed&#39;, which tells us that they are not actually claiming to know. 
I agree with mozsey, she does seem like a beautiful person in all ways, but of course we only know what we have seen here. There is no need to be so cynical about it though. ",1
13917,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"And that is often completely wrong. It is to make ugly people feel better, not that I am knocking the ugly, but I don&#39;t think that saying is true at all. I think that very pretty people have so many advantages, but that does not mean that they are ugly on the inside. Tall men with a full head of hair and big muscles also have a lot of advantages, doesn&#39;t mean that they are bad people!",1
13918,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I had a friend who did the same thing. We all have our need for escapism,&amp; the trick is to find the one that gives you the most pleasure, with the least harm to yourself or anyone else. I would imagine there are possibly less harmful porn videos out there? Don&#39;t really know, but I know that if a man in my life used porn I would vastly prefer that he look for less exploitative genres &amp; the best the industry has to offer, though I would prefer none at all!",1

13920,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,really? you don&#39;t even know her lol. One needs time to know a person and have a feeling about how beautiful or ugly that person is on the inside.,1
13921,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,no one forced her do be a model lol. Looks aren&#39;t everything but they are like 99% of it in our world as we know it today :) That is the truth. And I am so fed up with &#39;save the whales&#39; attitude and sympathy from this beautiful people &gt;&gt; fact is average to ugly looking people can deal with it - they have brains as any of the better looking and physically fit people can as well have. We are all equal - but do not have the same chances in life.,1

So naive...",1
13933,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She seemed very beautiful on the inside to me.,1
13934,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I disagree with you on that Eric. I agree that white people are willing to work hard but so are other races as well . I am an African American and I am proud of it and I am trying to make something of myself by going back to college. I know many successful people who are non-white and work hard!!,1
13935,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Me too Kyle. I was referred to this video for my college course. I wish that i would have been found it though. However, I felt a little uncomfortable when she talked about &quot;white privilege&quot; not to say that she was racist or anything. I feel that it is time someone talked about it because racism still exists. ",1
13936,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I admire her courage come up there and talk about this issue. It takes a lot of guts to talk about something that you benefit from. I really enjoyed it and it really showed me that image is a very powerful thing when it comes to jobs or whatever it may be. ,1

13938,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am sure people who are happy about their parentage are happier about the way they look!
Our self perception is always harsher. 
I also feel that knowing a person makes them more or less attractive. I have known gorgeous &amp; ugly people who look totally different to me once I know them. 
Maybe people get addicted to porn because it is something that you do not have to see a person as a whole - &amp; that is obviously not good, but may be caused by insecurity and fear of really engaging with someone. ",1

I am really stunned by this talk - not because I think that all models are stupid, but because it is actually pretty rare to hear someone this insightful and intelligent from any occupation (other than the intellectual - and even those may be emotionally stupid). I hope she gets out of modelling soon and makes the most of her considerable talents and potential. ",1
13943,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The porn industry is ugly whatever way you look at it. ,1
13944,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is acknowledging that she has white privilege. She is not saying that ALL men think that white women are the most beautiful. ,1
13945,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I know that men aren&#39;t supposed to think about it, but of course you do, and there are men you end up comparing yourself to unfavourably if you are insecure (not as many as women, but enough). But it sounds like you realise now that you are not ugly. When I was a teenager I thought I was hideous, but I wasn&#39;t!",1
13946,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think that SHE realises she is wasted on modelling, and as she clearly has so many other interests she will be fine. She didn&#39;t say what she did at college, but a woman this intelligent &amp; humble (and of course beautiful) is not going to struggle acheiving what she wants in life. ",1
13947,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,beautiful on the inside.,1
13948,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She owned that shit, and I have nothing but respect for her. ",1
13949,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It is sad to think that the powerful advertising medium has come to perpetuate women as objects of desire. Males are oblivious of the subliminal effects and are taught that the females body is her only valuable asset. Consumers must shift their awareness and actively participate in social activism such as Jean Kilbournes documentaries, change.org petitions. It is imperative that the media send out positive messages to present healthy, balanced, respectable images of females. ",1

13953,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this woman is fabulous,1
13954,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think a more fitting comparison can be dreaming of becoming a model and dreaming of becoming a soldier. In both cases, you trade in your individuality for what will likely be false promises.",1

13956,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you are complaining about a pretty person saying looks aren&#39;t everything, stop being jealous and bitter and try to listen to the message. The speech is supposed to stimulate you to think about how &quot;image affects our perceived failures and successes&quot; of ourselves and others. This is a powerful idea + she presented it in a fresh, honest way. You are doing the exact opposite of the message in the speeh: judging someone based on looks and not who they are. You are PART OF THE PROBLEM OF SOCIETY.",1
13957,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I disagree. Many people critique their field and do not leave it...people who do this are important to the fields they work in because it helps point out places for improvements. She is doing the same. We need people like that in every field. I commend her.,1
13958,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It is not meant to be inspirational. It is honest and gives a new perspective to a common hot topic in society. I found her sincerity very touching.,1
13959,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She did not say anything new but she said it in a way that was fresh and honest. There&#39;s value to that.,1
13960,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"He or she is just nitpicking, you can clearly see that the first one is indeed a bikini and the latter is a bathing suit.",1

13970,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think she meant she has never worn a bikini for modeling purposes.,1
13971,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are everything unfortunately. The better looking you are, the more easily it is for you to excel in multiple facets of life, whether dating, happiness, income and social status. It can be seen everywhere and in multiple streams of life. Stereotypes of beautiful people are often misrepresented in the media however. We think of them as stuck up arrogant people who are constantly spoiled. While there are many like this, there are others that are not. ",1
13972,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I disagree. I think she acknowledged how superficial her business is in the most honest way I have seen someone from that industry do it,1

13974,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That&#39;s gutsy to admit that she has such privilege for being white and tall. This is a good video to watch before talking to a daughter who wants to be a model or simply for talks bout body and beauty image with youth. Thank you Cameron.,1
13975,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow way to not take the message at all, ignorant dick.",1
13976,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"incorrect. some people are bound to be more attractive than others. fact of life. what i&#39;m inferring is that to compensate for the looks some people have been dealt, they&#39;ll go to great lengths (often harming their health in the process)",1

13984,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This talk was also superficial, miss Model.",1
13985,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"provocative and entertaining. models are like everybody else, their psychological hardware works the same way.

13999,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i find that it was hard for her to explain this point. but i understand how looks aren&#39;t everything. everything meaning there&#39;s more effort than just being pretty, and many decisions that don&#39;t depend on your looks but more on what others think...

14003,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love how she believes she &quot;totally&quot; transformed in six seconds...lol

Yeah you went from a hot girl in a tight dress, to a hot girl in a loose fitting dress.  You are still one of the prettiest people most will ever get to see up close.   This is like Eminem always crying in his music about how much it sucks to be rich, famous, and have everyone buying and liking the stuff you do.  ",1
14004,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"well bitter people everywhere in the comment section.

Her talk was really good, and she was honest and smart. There&#39;s only much you can dwell on  about this topic or the fashion industry in a short 10 minutes. But I guess everyone is too busy dismissing her because she&#39;s a white  model  so the good points of her talk get lost in your silly, closed mind.

14007,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Awesome talk. She has opened the door in people&#39;s minds and I love that she did that.,1
14008,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think you are spot on.  My observation was solely that when she dressed modestly, she looked so much more dignified and respectful...perhaps a reason to dress that way.  ",1
14009,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The most powerful point she made was she changed outfits.  She looked so much more dignified in the second outfit.,1
14010,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Who cares if it&#39;s &quot;hurtful&quot; lol. I&#39;m just telling it like it is and I know alot of men and women who would agree with me. These 100 pound, 6 foot women with no boobs or ass aren&#39;t attractive. Maybe they have a pretty face with some make-up on but big deal. Not to mention their personality is usually the most annoying thing in the world. Why doesn&#39;t she just get a real job instead of parading around like her shit don&#39;t stink.",1
14011,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ted speakers are only allowed 8 or 9 minutes each she is one of many who spoke that day.,1
14012,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She had the power to make a much bigger wave, but she really made a very shallow point. Of course, looks aren&#39;t everything, we&#39;ve been told this a million times in a million different ways. She should, first, make her talks a bit longer because I have faith that she probably has some very helpful insight, But with such a short time span, she seemed like half the time she was promoting herself and the remainder of the time wasn&#39;t enough to delve into deep realizations in her position.

14017,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah, but the problem likely wasn&#39;t that she didn&#39;t flesh it out so much as she tried to cram (or was allotted) 10 minutes to talk about a subject matter way too complex for such a short time. ",1
14018,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Cameron isn&#39;t even all that attractive in the first place. She is too tall and skinny. Most models are. She is just a mannequin for fashion which is simply just trying to sell it&#39;s product. I know many more better looking women who wouldn&#39;t fit the &quot;model mold&quot;.,1

14020,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"as i understand, the point of this was to let being super attractive seem undesirable, because hot people have particular problems of their own
but, frankly, i&#39;m not suddenly glad about not being hot now, nor will anyone else who isn&#39;t hot, suddenly no longer wish they were it
i appreciate her wanting to even things out, it IS considerate, considering she&#39;s the one profiting and all, but i don&#39;t feel this really helps:/",1

It&#39;s not &#39;liberal, white guilt&#39; to recognize, as have MANY MANY studies, that being very attractive, generates a LOT of advantages: socially, financially, politically!

People w/a  conscience, introspective skill, &amp; EYES can see this &amp; if they have GUTS-admit it in public!

That DOESN&#39;T make them a LIBERAL, or white guilt evangelist.

TPer&#39;s that I meet believe those who disagree are dumb, unpatriotic, brainwashed, liberal.  Even when the person is a MODERATE!

14055,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When talking about men, I agree with you. Advertising agencies usually portray the &quot;ideal man&quot; as being in peak physical condition, and well groomed, which there&#39;s nothing wrong with and something every man should strive for. With women, it&#39;s a whole other story that&#39;s unfixable at this point. When they try to emulate what they see in magazines, it actually leads to much less healthy lifestyle.",1
14056,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You probably think your comments shows how she can talk about looks since she &quot;has&quot; plenty of it, but it&#39;s actually quite the opposite. You just proved the guys point, because she never experienced &quot;not being pretty&quot; hence for her to say &quot;being good looking is not everything&quot; is not very believable - she hasn&#39;t been there.

Unfortunately this guys second part of the comment makes him look like typical jealous, bitter person. Believe it or not, models job is heck of a chore.",1
14057,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What&#39;s wrong with people wanting to look good, which (in general) correlates to and translates to being more healthy?

Should we idolize being fat, smelly with unhealthy skin and bad breath?

I realize big agencies cash on it and make big money out of it too, but what&#39;s wrong with that? No one is forcing people to spend their money on stuff they advertise, it&#39;s people&#39;s free will.",1

To her credit, she sounds compassionate for those who are not as fortunate as her.  But she had a strength (beauty) and made a career out of it.  Don&#39;t feel guilty about it!  And don&#39;t project ~your guilt~ onto others.  Some people are are comedians, or cops, or nurses, or mothers because that&#39;s what they&#39;re good at.

14066,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is such a fucking joke. &quot;I have to think about how I look every day&quot; like you should feel sorry for her or something. Lol! Shes just trying to make ugly people feel better about themselfs and u all now that is the truth! ,1

Imagine a life where everything goes your way and how difficult it would be to escape from a breezy Disney Land life.  My take is she didn&#39;t flesh this out as well as it could have been because she&#39;s not out of the Amusement Park yet, but clearly she&#39;s headed toward the exit.  Very humbling to watch this.",1

14071,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Now that you mention it, i&#39;d say men will be close to the same figure in the next 5 years. I&#39;ve read somewhere before that the male cosmetics market is actually in the billions now, and it will only increase as we become more insecure.",1

14073,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,damn i admire her now even more. ,1
14074,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I had to stop watching after I rolled down and saw your comment. I heard your violin playing &quot;My Heart Pumps Purple Piss&quot; and so everything so said annoyed the hell out of me. I wonder if she did this crap for free?,1
14075,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I do. It&#39;s a rich, famous model whining that she&#39;s been showered in money and adoration from birth for how she looks instead of for who she is. That and being irrationally insecure. Excuse me while I play the world&#39;s smallest violin for her.",1

14082,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I disagree. She was emphasising her point by admitting she is the beneficiary of what she is saying is wrong. It&#39;s like when you hear a police officer bring attention to corruption in law.,1

Actually, being a model makes you less believable, not more. It easy to say something isn&#39;t important when you have plenty of it. Just like how it&#39;s always rich people saying that money isn&#39;t everything. 

It&#39;s hilarious to me to hear &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; from someone who makes tons of money for standing there doing nothing while people take pictures, meanwhile I work my ass off for chump change.",1

I&#39;m old, fat, got big ears, arthritis, going deaf, bald, never been handsome etc, but I have loads of interests, lots of laughs &amp; I&#39;m comfortable in my skin.

Pacman is just one of the fighters we study.  What I&#39;ve learnt from boxing all these years, guys like pac, hearns, duran etc...They have a genetic gift that gives extra edge.  Combine that with their upbringing, environment, circumstances, you have legends.  Hardwork is just as important as circumstance and genes.  But u can&#39;t ctrl the last 2",1
14102,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Im not convinced enough. People like Mozart, or perhaps Pacquiao are seen as genetically talented. I 101% disagree with that. The truth about Mozart is that he was born into a musical environment. Pacqiao had a good teacher. You should check out Pacquiao&#39;s early boxing age videos on youtube. His fights when he was still a kid. He always loses. ",1
14103,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The fact that she can acknowledge the problems within her industry and the social problems it can create shows she has a good brain... and that makes her even more sexy in my opinion... ,1

I think all sports will require hard training and discipline to achieve great levels like Pacqiao and Mayweather do.",1

Well, then it&#39;s no longers surprising or meaning ful that almost all the models are &quot;white&quot; if that includes models who are 95% black or asian, etc.  By that standard, btw, our president Obama is no where NEAR being a black president.",1

14111,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Let&#39;s not confuse talent with skills. There are some talents you simply cannot teach. Being athletically gifted or being born with a genius level IQ are such talents. On the other hand, having talent alone doesn&#39;t mean much unless you work hard and hone your skills...especially those that compliment your talents. I mean look at basketball players. Do you think someone taught them height or they worked hard to grow up so tall? No but they worked on their skills. Genetics still has some part in it",1
14112,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was a really good talk. Good on her for having the courage to say things that were not comfortable for her to say.,1
14113,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Exactly! It wouldn&#39;t matter what she said, a lot of people still wouldn&#39;t want to hear it anyway, even if it was true, because of their own personal feelings on the subject. I don&#39;t think she was saying &quot;woe is me&quot; at all. ",1
14114,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t think that is what she was saying at all. I think that she was saying that in society in general, thin white women are considered the epitome of beauty, if you look at magazines/movies/television etc. Not that that is what SHE thinks is the epitome of beauty.",1
14115,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,8:26 ... does that mean that they&#39;re being launched into space?,1
14116,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,hello tekken fan lol,1
14117,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Here watch this watch?v=jh9ax4QvzoQ, i found Gladwell basically talking about success on youtube.  Around 25 minute mark, he explains how Steve Jobs would not have been head of Apple if he didn&#39;t grow up where he grew up.  I&#39;m sure he talks about Bill Gates as well, because in his book, he wrote about Gates and Job simultaneously.",1
14118,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Bill gates had circumstances in his favour.  You should read Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.  I think he may have given TED talks on the subject as well.

Gates got his 10000 hours early, before the majority of people even had access to computers.",1

If you&#39;re raped or has to deal with other peoples jealosy and hate it still doesn&#39;t make it a bad card. The bad card is you being foolish, having bad cicumstance luck or being stupid and foolish and so on. A card of ess is a card of ess. ",1
14120,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Of course you got to have the right set of mind to enjoy anything. It doesn&#39;t make a successful model career any bad. WHat she&#39;s trying to say is that some models barely have the backbone to enjoy anything. Of course it takes hard work. Her scope isn&#39;t very developed.,1

14126,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree skills have nothing to do with genetics.  But guys like mayweather jr., pacquiao, tesla, have MORE than just skills, they have circumstances and genetics that put them on another level.  Using Mayweather and Pacman as example, their handspeed is a genetic gift.  Pacman&#39;s punching power is related to his body structure (ie. genetics).  Tesla had photographic memory, personality abnormalities etc..(genetics again) all contributed to his super genius.",1

14138,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, her presentation was pretty terrible. &quot;Image is Power&quot;. Umm yeah, thanks for the update I didn&#39;t know this was a Middle School educational program. Also, &quot;I just totally transformed what you thought of me in 6 seconds&quot;. No, no you didn&#39;t. I really could have cared less what your wearing and the presentation lacked any ground-breaking or thought provoking material to the semi-educated person.  ",1
14139,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow a top model telling us that she&#39;s insecure.  Never heard that one before.  The most interesting thing she had to say was that the image is constructed.  At least she is humble.,1
14140,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"you say she&#39;s immodest, perhaps she&#39;s just honest? even the most modest people know what they&#39;re good at as well as their shortcomings, and, lets be honest, if we&#39;re judging her purely physical attractiveness as &quot;how many guys would tap that&quot; with no knowledge as to what she&#39;s like, then i&#39;d guess you could say shes hot! why should she not be allowed to admit it?",1

14142,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she absolutely does not belief that,1
14143,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The way she looks is very attractive. I don&#39;t think it is a mere social construction. Type &quot;True Theory of Everything Quadrant Model of Reality 1&quot; into YouTube for the Truth.,1
14144,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Try to understand what she is trying to say. And the point you are trying to say is exactly something that she is pointing at. She agrees that our societal beliefs have made us believe that we can make a living on looks alone. However, it is not so true and when u talk of making a living out of looks, u basically are running a race against time. U know u can&#39;t be pretty forever and very soon ur looks r going to fade away. thats the insecutiry u get with such career.",1
14145,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But isn&#39;t that the point she&#39;s making? That the fact it&#39;s possible to make a living and get things in life for free shows how superficial we are? I think she&#39;s trying to say that realistically looks aren&#39;t everything, but we&#39;ve tricked ourselves into thinking they are........I do see your point though.",1
14146,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she explicitly states the racism inherent in the industry so your criticism is based on a misinterpretation of her comments.,1
14147,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s hard to take someone seriously when they say &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; when their career is based solely upon their looks and their looks alone are enough to get them a living.,1
14148,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She looks nervous and she&#39;s not really organized. ,1
14149,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But does your opinion of someone change when you learn that they are a doctor? Do you not question what they say less because they are a doctor? We assume because they are a doctor and have a piece of paper that their opinions or worth listening to. It is natural for animals to use cognitive shortcuts for survival. We may feel that we are cleverer than other animals but we too use shortcuts on our opinion of someone because they way they look, their occupation and achievements.",1
14150,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"most of these comments are ridiculous. perhaps some balding overweight scientist with pie charts would have gotten different comments (though have said the exact same thing).
i for one am glad to have viewed her talk cause i was thinking about becoming a model.",1
14151,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she is trying to say that our unrealistic perceptions of beauty are damaging to everybody, even those considered the ideal of beauty because not even &quot;ideal&quot; people are considered beautiful without makeup artists, hair stylists, photoshop.. and only in certain poses or from certain angles. She wasn&#39;t trying to say whoa is me, but whoa something is wrong with how we think about beauty and how much being &quot;ideal&quot; is important to us as a global culture. ",1
14152,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ok it&#39;s great that she tries to change something and bring awareness to racial biases but I wish she lived one day as an ugly or even just normal-looking person. THEN she would know what insecurities are..,1
14153,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Believe me, I&#39;m more than fluent in English. I understood clearly what she &quot;wanted&quot; to say, but I also heard what she said instead.

14154,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she is acknowleding the unfair treatment and still bitches about what cruel stuff it has done to her... She feels like her good looks are a burden and that she feels guilty about it, which is just stupid.",1
14155,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this organization is all so fake.

14157,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I guess you dont speak fluent english as you clearly misunderstood the points she was making. Since when is getting out of a fine for being good looking bitching about how hard life is?,1

She&#39;s acknowledging the unfair and superficial way that image define&#39;s women&#39;s value in the eyes of society for better or worse, and that even as a model who benefits from that unfair imbalance. She just doesnt provide a solution. ",1
14159,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I like that she addresses the problem...its great that she herself is aware of how unfair standards of beauty are, but there was no dialogue about a solution. I really like and agree with what she has to say....but simply talking about the problem isnt enough and won&#39;t help women.",1
14160,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What a charming lady :)
",1
14161,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i guess you watched a different video than i did...,1
14162,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The talk focuses too much on her own person. She seems to feel guilty about her privileges and this is the way to lift that personal burden. The racial aspect seems a bit constructed and not really core of the issue of superficiality, if of course it still is somewhat important to keep in mind.",1
14163,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is&#39;nt bitching about it. She&#39;s explaining that becasue of the way society treats people based on looks, it makes her life much easier because of luck and that this needs to be stopped. Not that shes  model and has a hard life. You are very stupid sir.",1
14164,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I hate the term &quot;genetic lottery&quot;.,1
14165,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this woman is proof that you can be given everything and still bitch about it and be insecure, but the worst part is that people call her brave and strong because of it, even give her credit. makes me sick, sorry.",1
14166,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great video !,1
14167,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Dhrhf d,1
14168,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she is honest and courageous. she wanted to share her thought of how people mostly misinterprets being happy. she is just gorgeous, not only superficially, but from the inner core.",1
14169,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hm. I disagree and think that your comment &#39;reeks&#39; of smugness and arrogance.  Even when a woman is critiquing her own profession and its superficial ideals (while acknowledging her own part in it), she can&#39;t escape someone&#39;s appraisal and damning conclusion that she is lacking in some way (i.e., immodest, insecure).  Thank god there are people (particularly men) willing to step forward and judge women if not on their physical appearance, than on their presumed character traits.",1
14170,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You were pretty before I heard you speak.  You became beautiful after I heard you speak.,1
14171,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she did a great job.  She is too pretty to make herself look &quot;average&quot; though lol, even with the long skirt and without the heels, still GORGEOUS!",1
14172,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m Mormon, I want to marry you",1
14173,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No, its more like:
Supermodel: &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot;
Billionaire: &quot;money isn&#39;t everything&quot;
Which is true. Being good looking or having money will make life easier, but it isn&#39;t everything. Being good looking or rich will not make you happier. It will make you more free to obtain happiness if you know how to do it. Happiness doesn&#39;t come from superficial things, it comes from inside.",1
14174,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thank you! well stated,1
14175,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,TRUE,1
14176,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she is amazing ,1
14177,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How refreshing to see a well thought out comment rather than one that trashes what she says and who she is. I think the people who trash other people and make derogatory comments to other commenters are 10 times more insecure than Cameron and probably dislike themselves more than they obviously envy others.,1
14178,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Awe, the trials and tribulations of models. It must be so rough. What a whiner.",1
14179,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i&#39;m fine with you thinking it&#39;s true. but you can&#39;t generalize. maybe for the US, but not for the entire world.",1
14180,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Trash.,1
14181,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,no one else watching this video does. matthew edgley&#39;s comment is hidden.,1
14182,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she is so inspiring to me,1
14183,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what? m ot white im poitig out the reason white wome are seen as the most beautiful is  cause the media is run by white men,1
14184,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I admire her courage, trying to come out and say what it is like in real. Far too many waste their lives wanting to be models and actors... People here have called her Hippocratic (wonder how that fits her, she spoke the truth!). Applaud her for being honest.",1
14185,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,says a white man.,1
14186,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love her message, she is only trying to be honest and wake up the world from the fictional image publicity and fashion have been selling over decades. She has realized than being &quot;pretty looking&quot; is not making her confident or happy and therefore she wants to tell everyone than being a model is not the answer for happiness and personal fulfillment. ",1
14187,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I was going to post the same exact comment,1
14188,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I applaud her courage to share what is in her heart! She is finding who she really is!,1
14189,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s a hypocrite,1
14190,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Until I make head on a stick on you.,1
14191,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Then why comment yourself?,1
14192,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a sweet heart!,1
14193,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,@MisterHeizenberg if you like fat women it doesn&#39;t mean skinny ones are &#39;ugly bitches&#39;....,1
14194,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you.,1
14195,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why is she so out of breath?,1
14196,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But most humans are superficial ,stupid and horny by natural.And its because of this fact that she is able to make it to this presentation.Irony of life.",1
14197,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Maybe the whole genius to this presentation is that no one is meant to notice how terrible it was because it&#39;s a model on stage instead of someone educated.,1
14198,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If anyone misinterpreted her message, it was you. Granted this talk contained way too much fluff. Her goal was for the audience to grasp the idea of &quot;perceived&quot; successes and failures. Instead she just bashed her profession while randomly trying to add awareness to racism and sexism. Good intentions or not, if you were focusing on the content of this talk, and not her &quot;apparent intellect&quot; you&#39;d notice that she just pulled together an absolutely terrible presentation",1
14199,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks arent everything, but I still wish I were beautiful.",1
14200,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,144 p?? ,1
14201,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s so hot I had to watch this on mute.,1
14202,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I would hate to be a model and I totally see where she is coming from. Think of it this way, we can go outside with our less than perfect bodies or hair  or clothes, and people may generally be polite and not mention it, if models or any famous person does they are slaughtered everywhere, being called &quot;chubby&quot; &quot;spotty&quot; &quot;tired&quot; I know its not a life I&#39;d want  ",1
14203,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Maybe they&#39;re insecure about the fact that they may not always be able to outdo/ outshine those &quot;regular&quot; women? And how they may not look more fabulous than the women around them the next day, the next moment.",1
14204,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"completely agree with you, i applaud her, and also, to me, she became more beautiful inside than outside",1
14205,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s sounds pretty reasonable. You can tell who she&#39;s targeting in this talk. It&#39;s not for everyone, most people know this stuff as common sense. But then you have shows like Top Model glorifying a modelling career as if it requires some sort of talent instead luck. They throw around phrases like &quot;its all in the eyes&quot; and shit like that.I think this is a good talk for teen girls who watch TLC and dream of being supermodels-- a nice dose of common sense.",1
14206,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You are incorrect.  Furthermore, it&#39;s possible to feel insecure even when you&#39;re not comparing yourself to anything or anyone. ",1
14207,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,didnt hear it,1
14208,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I feel like the first 3 minutes of this are part of a bad sitcom but, without the laugh track. ",1
14209,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If you listen carefully, there&#39;s one women who literally shrieks whenever she tells a joke.",1
14210,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Models are insecure because they are surrounded by other models. They&#39;re insecure that younger models will replace them. A model in a group of regular women would not be insecure. ,1
14211,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,beautiful mind :),1
14212,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So many people have misinterpreted precisely the message she is trying to convey. It&#39;s not that she personally perceives the image of a white tall, slender woman to personify beauty but rather high fashion circles idealise that image as the pinnacle of beauty. I admire her willingness to speak candidly about the trade she cashes in from. The fact she admits she feels insecure is extremely brave. In my eyes her true beauty comes from her apparent intellect not just her aesthetic appeal.",1
14213,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but we already knew all of the things she&#39;s saying,1
14214,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Apolobragging,1
14215,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Trust me, I&#39;m a duck.
",1
14216,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s saying that she has had an advantage her entire life based on her looks (and her race), and it shouldn&#39;t be like that. She showed pictures of herself wearing normal clothes to show that modeling isn&#39;t about her looks, it&#39;s about how the photographer constructs an image. She&#39;s educated, she graduated from Columbia University with a Bachelor&#39;s in Economics and Political Science. She met the President when she was 10 years old by writing a letter to his staff.",1
14217,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"No I don&#39;t think she&#39;s bragging about herself, she&#39;s saying that the concept of beauty in America has always been being thin and white. That&#39;s what the MAJORITY of people think about when they think about beauty. And she&#39;s saying the system is wrong in presenting this image because people everywhere are unhappy with the way that they look. ",1
14218,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,is it me she did she not really say anything? she just spoke and the rest was up to us I don&#39;t mean i need someone to hold my hand through new views but what she said saws neither here nor there. no outstanding point.  ,1
14219,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Title should be, &quot;Pretty in a blink?
&quot;",1
14220,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I have a friend called Cameron Russell. Believe me, he isn&#39;t a model.",1
14221,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Is there a word for self-deprecation that is so over the top it circles around and sounds almost like bragging?,1
14222,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think a lot of you are missing her point about beautiful in the modelling industry. She isn&#39;t saying tall, slender, and white is what she thinks of as beautiful or most people, but the modelling industry does. Look at most people on the runway and &quot;tall, slender, and white&quot; is a majority of the models. And she even says the racial aspect is a problem. ",1
14223,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What she meant by &quot;I won the genetic lottery&quot; is that she has a set of genetics that the modelling industry looks for, which is tall, slender, and usually white. She isn&#39;t saying she is a human ideal, but what the screwed up modelling industry sees as ideal.",1
14224,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Your argument is invlaid, you have obviously never heard on WW2. It was KINDA of a big thing that happened in Europe not long ago. ",1
14225,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"looks are everything believe me - I have to heads, three legs and spiral buttocks ",1
14226,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Uhh what? Speak for yourself...,1
14227,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Here&#39;s an example that you can be extremely beautiful and also have a brain and a conscience. She acknowledges all the advantages she&#39;s had in life because of her looks, and also the hardships of people who are less blessed by mother nature or from minority ethnic groups. She&#39;s basically saying that: she knows the social discrimination in her favor is unfair; a lot of what we see is &quot;fake&quot;, retouched; being pretty =/= being happy; she wants to be judged beyond her physical appearance.",1
14228,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The most useless, pointless TED talk I have ever seen. This was absolute garbage. Only reason she was up there is because she is a model. Pathetic",1
14229,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I guess she was a pioneer being the first on TED to talk about this and putting clothes on stage. I also admire her honesty. For a title &quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a model.&quot; I expected more. But may be she can give another talk, unless the TED curators decided not to have her again :P.",1
14230,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think the points are good, and she is brave to speak her mind regarding modeling and beauty... and the effects of appearence",1
14231,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,People judge upon what they see but not what they know. Just remember Susan Boyle first came on stage and how people laughed at her but when she sang  people gone mad. People  u lose so much by looking at  cover! ,1
14232,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"if she didnt look like she does, nobody would have watched the video",1
14233,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i&#39;d still bone,1
14234,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"what a beautiful girl
",1
14235,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"now i am askig myself, is it true? white skin, being tall and beautiful does it matter? well dont think so, the most beautiful girl i know is only 1.58 cm tall, i was together with her, when an okay looking friend i got came over and said: hey i think i just saw the most beautiful girl in the world, in the first place i thought he meant her, but then he pointed at this girl, she had black skin and she was really chubby.. and then i figured, looks only matters if you wants to be on magazines..so.",1
14236,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,There are sooooo many beautiful non white women out there. They are not just too attracted in the model business. Most of them are not willing to expose their bodies to the whole world or  to starve themselves for money. I like her but she is soooooo wrong about who is beautiful or not.,1
14237,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"huh, smart girl. Lots of people today don&#39;t know about the &quot;what&#39;s beautiful is good&quot; bias which affects us every day, it&#39;s particularly based on facial characteristics/symmetry and is not so much relevant to bodies since bodies are culturally relative. Faces are perceived as more attractive as they become more averaged, meaning if you have a facial feature that is on the extreme end i.e. big nose then you&#39;re ugly whereas an average nose = attractive. ",1
14238,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you guys are mean dear gosh. her point of this was to say that being skinner wont make you happier because models are skeletons and they are some of the most insecure people in the world. this wasnt mind blowing but its obvipusly hard for her to say these things so chill.,1
14239,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"
u are getting too old for a model, and now u trying to look so special

go and eat something you hypocrite skeleton",1
14240,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think you missed the point of my comment which is: if she feels like it&#39;s wrong for people to discriminant based on looks and say all these bad things about these people who give her free stuff, why did she a)take the dress for free instead of not accepting it and b)pay the ticket and tell the police officer to not be nice to her just because she looks good. Her speech is a good observation, but she&#39;s still a model. Her words though true is not reflected in her actions.",1
14241,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you can&#39;t necessarily**,1
14242,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You can necessarily aspire to be a model, its more based on genetic factors (facial features). Most models are recruited or advised on becoming a model...no person off the street  can become a  fashion model, even if they have the body of thor. You can aspire to become a fitness model, but even then you need some good facial features",1
14243,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wonderful.. It was a fresh perspective from the other side you know? ,1
14244,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Look at you, recognizing your privilege. You go, Cameron. 

You go.",1
14245,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"no, I think the long dress looked gorgeous",1
14246,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol my question is why is she a model when she talks about it as something that people shouldn&#39;t aspire to be? why did she not become a ninja cardio surgeon? her speech just makes everyone feel a bit better about themselves and thats about it =/,1
14247,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol - I concurr completely. ,1
14248,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ditto,1
14249,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This should be called, &quot;Looks matter, but here&#39;s some reasons why they shouldn&#39;t.&quot;",1
14250,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m in agreement with your first sentence.  I think a lot of this has to do with the title.  My suggestion: &quot;Looks do matter, but here&#39;s why they shouldn&#39;t.&quot;",1
14251,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why do woman think the tight dress is attractive? I like the long dress. It is mysterious and elegant. 

Am I the only man that feels that way?",1
14252,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not necessarily better, but they will get by alot easier.   ",1
14253,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Regardless of what this women says, good looking people have it better in life. When I mean good looking, I mean model/celebrity/everyone thinks your good looking. From social attention, to treatment, to opportunities, they get it better in life.",1
14254,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Powerful message.  Appreciate her honesty and sincerity.  ,1
14255,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wah I&#39;m a model...Wah!!,1
14256,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Proof positive that beauty is from within! Great talk! :-),1
14257,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,^^^ pure example of what shes talking about in the vid,1
14258,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I disagree, I think she gives us a deeper glimpse into the human condition. The point is the pure happiness we expect out of people who are in a better position than us (Pro athletes, actors, models) is not there and I think it&#39;s telling. We get irrationally angry when we hear about rich people being unhappy, but that&#39;s just the human condition. We are all running on a hedonistic treadmill. ",1
14259,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I liked this one she did a very good job. Also the difference photos were great because they just showed that wonderful truth on a lot of those pictures we all see.,1
14260,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I really enjoyed this. I wouldn&#39;t say it was the most well organized talk, I wouldn&#39;t say it was mind blowing or anything. Even the end seemed a bit anti-climactic. But I really liked it. It seemed obvious to me how hard it was for her to say some of those things. It was an interesting perspective I&#39;m not used to, and it was honest. I think she did a great job :).",1
14261,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She hates her self you can tell.,1
14262,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The talk is called looks aren&#39;t everything and then she explains how looks are everything. Pretty dumb.,1
14263,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This video is a disgrace for everyone involved.,1
14264,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"worst Ted Talk ever. What I learned from this:

Life is easier for the attractive (duh)
contrary to popular belief: not all models like Ms. Russell are happy about the benefits. (Bullshit).
Looks are everything, just look at models.
Models aren&#39;t gorgeous all the time. (snoreeeeee) 

It&#39;s nice to see some consciousness and an understanding of the privileges awarded to the attractive and not others. Ted, get your act together. ",1
14265,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People are usually aware of their strengths and weaknesses, especially in the cases you mention. Calling attention to them doesn&#39;t change anything and only makes people feel insecure.  Focus on strengths.  Cameron Russell is aware of her good looks and privilege and she used her strengths to make a change.  A TED talk is clearly more than a FB post.  Would that be considered genuine support? Would she be considered &quot;worthy&quot;? I think so. Does her skin make her idea less important? I think not.   ",1
14266,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You&#39;re arguing for the sake of arguing.  Who determines genuine support? You? I agree that more should be done, but don&#39;t knock people just because they aren&#39;t &quot;going to the lengths&quot; you believe they should.  I understand where you&#39;re coming from and you clearly care in some way, but why worry about how much other people are doing? You do it, and other people will follow.  An idea doesn&#39;t gain traction until a critical mass of people agree with it, or at least - are aware of it.  ",1
14267,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"people need to realize that they have limitations and have specific weaknesses. You shouldn&#39;t be talking about NFL if you don&#39;t agree with the latter statement. Also i was talking about the morbidly obese. 

Always good to play at your strengths, i agree.",1
14268,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this doesn&#39;t need to be gender specific anymore. Any American posting facebook or twitter updates is technically on the side of those &#39;poor HIV infected Africans.&#39; It takes more than an image or a fart to show that you genuinely support something and are willing to go to lengths to prove it.,1

14280,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"again looks SHOULD matter. Otherwise we would have people wearing casual clothing to work and Harlem shaking all over the place. Equality is a farce. A dwarf knows that he is at a disadvantage in terms of his height. An obese person knows that his athletic ability is compromised. Sure they might have OTHER essential criteria that makes them special or helps them compensate, but a weakness is a weakness. The sooner people accept their weaknesses the sooner they move forward.",1
14281,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"hey i am with you if the woman is actively WORKING in Africa against HIV and has the credentials, that way she would actually have a RIGHT to advertise and spread awareness.
however shifting the demographic isn&#39;t so black and white. Convincing modelling agencies to take affirmative action requires societal pressure. It comes down to subversion against years of racial conditioning (it ain&#39;t as easy as a TED talk)",1
14282,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The misunderstanding was meant to the people that think those pictures are real.
Ok, if you are talking about discriminations on tv and adds sure, ok. But that&#39;s not a really important industry. On most, no one will argue about someone being black or whatever.
Or at least that&#39;s the way in the place I live, Europe. Where racial discrimination ended hundreds of years ago, not a couple of decades.",1

14284,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Again, looks *shouldn&#39;t* matter. Why is it relevant that a person is little, obese or an amputee? Obviously their physical limitations preclude them from certain physically involved careers but in all else it should be a level playing field. I understand that there is a gap between what actually happens and the ideal situation, but anything that moves the conversation forward is a boon IMO.  ",1
14285,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This taboo is so dumb.  SO dumb.  So a white woman doing front-line work fighting against AIDS in Africa shouldn&#39;t have an opinion on minority rights and power imbalances ESPECIALLY for the people she is trying to help? If you&#39;re not seeing the ridiculous bias here, none of what I&#39;m writing will mean anything.  And yes, images are often exploited.  IMO, Hip hop is 90% image.

People fight those who are all talk. All words help us do is create an image. Images can be used to either
1. help make good models (healthy)
2. make loads of of money for a simple image without any practical implication. (perverse)

The latter is what talks USUALLY end up being. If her talk has ramifications that change the demographic in modelling and Hollywood kudos to her ",1
14288,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"to say: &quot;looks shouldn&#39;t matter&quot; would be utter hypocrisy in her case?

Instead why not tackle this issue: looks DO matter and looks SHOULD matter? If i was a dwarf i would know my limitations... if i was obese i would know my limitations.. if i was an amputee i would know that i am in an obvious disadvantage.

To say &quot;looks don&#39;t matter&quot; to a crowd of little people, amputees and the morbidly obese is likely to get her slapped in the face. Race shouldn&#39;t matter, but looks SHOULD matter.",1
14289,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s very pretty,1

14291,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love how honest she is!,1
14292,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"We have racism, prejudice, and discrimination of all sorts because people refuse to look past race. White women can&#39;t have an opinion because they&#39;re &quot;privileged&quot;, just as black men can&#39;t drive without being pulled over because they&#39;re &quot;up to no good&quot;.

And it doesn&#39;t make sense to me why people fight against people who are on their side. If change is really what people want, then why are they so picky about who makes it happen? Fight the oppressors, not the ones who are trying to help.",1
14293,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is completely fair, and on many occasions is the case. However, if a person is speaking out about an issue dear to my heart and our viewpoints are similar, I refuse to look to their skin first.  I&#39;ll look to their message 10/10. Else who is going to break the cycle? What compounds this is that people who have privilege and power are the ones who can make the most difference. Let&#39;s have more Tyra Banks and let&#39;s make the end result the focus while involving whoever it takes to get it done.  ",1
14294,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I feel as though she clearly says that looks matter, in spite of the title of the video. Her points on legacy and genes evince this. What I feel she says is that looks *shouldn&#39;t* matter.  A semantic difference, but an important one.  ",1
14295,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I have no problem with opposing a flawed power structure.  However, this is NOT like either of the two sensationalizing examples you provided.  This is a person who is calling attention to an issue while others fail to do so.  I would be happy to see people of colour/minority status take the torch and speak out as well.  To recognize you have privilege and call for action to level the playing field is a far cry from maintaining your power at all costs.  Not everyone can be Mother Teresa.  ",1
14296,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she is insecure maybe because she have spent her precious teenage years to be a model instead of learning and understanding the unknown world and unknown field. Maybe thats why she told the girls who wanna be a model do something else,1
14297,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I was shocked when she said she also felt insecure! It is such magnanimity to tell the truth about whom we think &quot;Have it all&quot;,1
14298,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i agree it is border line racist of me not to look past her skin, but people need to know that minorities are sensitized to the superficial. Any party that feels underrepresented or oppressed does not want the dominating party to speak FOR them.

What dominating parties end up doing is reducing people they speak for to percentages or statistics (which is sad).",1
14299,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"In modelling your looks do indeed heavily define you. Same with porn but hey porn is much more diverse than modelling or Hollywood. Can you venture a guess why that is?

I am focusing on her looks and her socioeconomic status because they have definitely played a role in getting her where she is. Instead of saying &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything&quot; she should be expressing the obvious truth that got her to the pulpit &quot;looks MATTER&quot;.  It is ironic for a model to say that they don&#39;t",1
14300,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i am being close minded for a reason (if i were to nod in approval and not pose dissent against this flawed power structure i would get nowhere). She herself stated that she is one of the beneficiaries of a biased system that glamorizes and imposes an &quot;ideal&quot; look for women in society. That is like a Nazi feeling bad for the Jews, or a slave owner sympathizing with his/her &quot;property.&quot;

If i were to look past her appearance i would judge her as a human being.. she would cease to be a model :)",1
14301,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That wasn&#39;t the point of her talk. ,1
14302,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think the reason it&#39;s a white woman speaking is the whole point of her speech; white models are the majority in the modeling industry. Also, those majority of white models are not coming out and giving speeches like this either; this woman clearly has put herself out there when other models won&#39;t. Not looking past her skin b/c you&#39;re a minority is silly",1
14303,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ttt,1
14304,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But if the emphasis is on dreaming to be more than a model, then who better to speak of that than a model who knows the industry, and how it&#39;s run? The video touches on the selection process, but her point is not the selection of models. It is that image is superficial, and even though you may look different, that should not be what defines you. So, to judge a woman&#39;s level of thought and understanding by focusing on her looks and financial status is somewhat ironic for a video of this nature.",1
14305,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why don&#39;t you suggest that to a member of the demographic you would like to see present? I agree that there is clear prejudice in terms of model selection.  The reality is that this lady took a lot of risk in order to make this happen. Others aren&#39;t as courageous. Yeah there&#39;s a bunch of guilt there, but I feel that not looking past her skin makes you seem closed minded, instead of her.  You ask some good questions in your reply to brettmdoc.  ",1
14306,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It would be a shame if you did not build muscle when these other normal people are able to get ripped  easily with &quot;RushMax Muscle&quot; (Google it).,1

As a colored individual myself i am sick and tired of white American superheroes saving the poor from themselves. I will not look past her skin i am a MINORITY",1
14309,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So if a prostitute from Afghanistan stood up there and said the same exact thing, you would completely agree? If so, I&#39;m curious as to why you wait for a specific type of person to say something before you take it into consideration. If you agree with the moral, then you agree with the moral. What she looks like should have no bearing on your own opinion.",1

spoiled... pampered... rich... opinionated... women
so far from reality... so superficial and verbose... so untouched by the physicality of nature... it hurts.",1
14312,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think there&#39;s definitely something in what she&#39;s saying. There have been more than a few times when I feel I have been treated differently in response to how I look and this has been proven time and time again in Psychological studies. That females/attractive females receive more positive treatment than their counterparts. E.g Outcomes in court cases.

14344,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Who on earth said a thing about fat people? This isn&#39;t about whether you&#39;re overweight or not, it&#39;s about being model material. It does depend on genetics whether you&#39;re 6 feet, it does depend on genetics whether your hipbones are too wide, it does depend on genetics whether you have a defined jaw-line, it does depend on genetics whether you have a symmetric face or not. You can be as skinny as you want, that won&#39;t give you all other attributes. Being thin is not enough to be a model.",1

Why do we let models speak at all?!?&quot; I just had to post this back to them.

14354,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,,1
14355,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,just because someone kissed enough ass in high school to get into a prestigious college doesn&#39;t make them intelligent. I agree with what you say except that she doesn&#39;t talk about why they shouldn&#39;t matter at all.,1
14356,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think you&#39;re being slightly unfair. To begin with she&#39;s far from stupid, she&#39;s studying a b eco &amp; pol sci at Columbia University; that aside, the point she&#39;s making is our preconceived conceptions about what is beauty have consequences on everyone, especially those who are being discriminated on solely on the basis they don&#39;t fit this idealistic model. So yes, we do need to talk about looks, but we need to talk about why they shouldn&#39;t matter in our society.",1
14357,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sure. A lot of people are blind to the fact that appearance and value aren&#39;t codependent, something you have obviously figured out already. Not everyone is as enlightened. You need to acknowledge something before you can do anything about it, and unfortunately not everyone has acknowledged that it&#39;s wrong yet. She has at least done that, which is more than can be said for a lot of people. ",1
14358,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I understand and concur completely.,1
14359,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"thats what im saying. She&#39;s a lazy, borderline stupid hypocrite. Not only that but she is telling us that we need to think about how looks matter more... as if we don&#39;t think about that enough. We need to think less about looks. Minorities are less vulnerable to body image problems perhaps partially because they are underrepresented in media. She wants to bring the snake oil that she sells to everyone, and she thinks that if she&#39;s honest about it, it won&#39;t do any harm.",1
14360,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"so its kind of like a practicing nazi (model) telling us they nazism (modelling) is wrong, which is already obvious, without telling us how we can stop it, and without stopping herself. THanks, what a revelation.",1
14361,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"shes actually saying the exact opposite of what you said. shes saying that we need to acknowledge the way that we view appearance in the hopes that we can change our perspective. This also goes much further than appearance, considering the fact that she didn&#39;t have to &quot;do&quot; anything to get to where she&#39;s at when other people try so hard and get nothing. Having value in our culture is very skewed and she&#39;s recognizing it. ",1
14362,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You are obviously a white person. There is still a gigantic racial bias. In the US you never see any dark black women with natural hair on tv or magizenes , in Canada you don&#39;t see any aborigional women in magazines or TV. Even if it is made to that audience. Marketing comes from brain washing, and shaming not misunderstanding. ",1
14363,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"exactly, i think were supposed to act impressed because usually models have trouble with polysyllable words. But really this just reinforces the status quo. A model telling us we should think more about how important looks are. WHich is the opposite of what people should really be thinking about.",1
14364,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,In the words of Tevia: &quot;May i be smitten and neeeever recover!&quot; I do recognize that she exposed herself to a lot of criticism and for that i especially applaud her. But she&#39;s so beautiful she&#39;ll survive :) ,1

14366,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Excellent,1

14368,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Women (in a way) have been taught into thinking beauty is a form of superficial value.

1. You can either believe the lie and live a worse life than you could have.

2. You can accept the truth that beauty is not all that you and society makes it out to be and live life in a fuller way that you never new existed :))))",1
14369,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, whites should hate themselves for being born.",1
14370,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I like her and admire her for giving this talk.,1
14371,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah its called, Money.",1
14372,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So glad she did this presentation. Uncomfortable subject- our shallowness. ,1
14373,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Last, when it comes to popular models, overpaid college sports coaches, actors, and politicians, I only put partial blame/dislike towards them. The majority of the blame must go to the general public and their misguided priorities, particularly the stupid store clerks who gave Cameron a dress for free and the dumb cop who let her and her friend go. Overall, she&#39;s neither brave or wrong. It&#39;s all neutral. Back to square one. Tell me something I don&#39;t know. ",1
14374,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Also, will she be so candid as to really motivate the public to challenge the fashion system, to the point where it might compromise the industry and her career in the process? Probably not. NOTE: I looked into her educational history and it IS impressive. The act of her revealing this concrete truth is nothing fearless. The fearless move would be if she moved to a more chalenging profession of industrial design, nursing, or any other professional field, and thus do modeling on the side. ",1
14375,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The process of creating films, video games, fashion shoots, and advertisements involve A LOT of workers (models and actors included) of different talents to create an adjusted fantasy to sell clothes, gadgets, and movie tickets (cool things we all buy, myself included). That is all nothing new. It&#39;s good old fashioned marketing. She&#39;s speaking as if the people in the room don&#39;t know the process. If that&#39;s true, that most people don&#39;t know, we&#39;re in a lot of trouble. ",1
14376,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I would&#39;ve loved to hear more from her.,1
14377,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She may have been a model and wasn&#39;t happy with it, but so what? Maybe she couldn&#39;t afford to quit her job because she knew how other people were treated compared to her. Some cops get special treatment and they aren&#39;t always happy, but they can&#39;t just quit. She might&#39;ve done it for ten years because she needed the money and work. She didn&#39;t model to make people feel insecure. She did it because that&#39;s a job and you need one of those to make it anywhere.",1
14378,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So goes to show how much you really know about the speaker by claiming she is still doing professional modelling,1
14379,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She complains she is insecure, but fact is that she contributed 10 years of skinny white woman modelling to make millions feel insecure. Then she present those numbers and pretends she wasnt part of it but the industry alone. Nice. If she thinks the world is so unfair she should stop doing professional modelling and take a part time job at the local super market.",1
14380,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree she is brave cus she looked pretty nervous, but I dont think there was any take away from this? She said it herself, she won a lottery and there is nothing other person can do. I was going to write something in her favor but then i realized she already let her beauty pay for her education. I dont see why shes amazing and any different from any of her legacy.",1
14381,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,fucking amazing and i still have 2 minutes left to go!!!!!!!!,1
14382,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She was making a big announcement to the world that she may be the image of perfection but she is far from it. I&#39;d imagine it was terrifying which would increase her heart rate and cause heavy breathing.

14384,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful people problems.,1
14385,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful :D and smart :) ,1
14386,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree about the sizing and look being sold to people, and unrealistic, but I see no reason to bring white guilt into it. It&#39;s a yawn and boring. It&#39;s status quo. The obsession with entertainment, modeling and etc is fairly new and a select few push this..not society as a whole. Why not name the select few and attack them? This woman benefits from her beauty so hearing the whole insecurity thing gets the BS meter going. I bet she won&#39;t marry a dog or a poor guy? So her whole speech goes out.",1
14387,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Agree acknowledging race shouldn&#39;t be guilt, but I find it funny that the only time guilt is associated with race is when it is white. Beauty standards are nature and association. They have tried to push the whole multi cultural and diversity junk down our throats for decades and not much has changed all that much. If you go to many meetings or groups of folk people segregate up on their own. If white is seen as the most beautiful why should we attempt to change that? ",1
14388,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Long discussion short: That implies that her being a model (which is highly dependent on looks) is &quot;everything&quot;. But we&#39;re not entirely defined by our profession. If anything, it makes her even more credible BECAUSE she has the capacity to test the hypothesis that &quot;looks are everything&quot; (which she rejects). So no, her being a model does not discredit her opinion.",1
14389,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but shouldn&#39;t her being a model be a reason to discredit her opinion?,1
14390,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Acknowledging race as an issue isn&#39;t &#39;white guilt&#39;. Skin color is still a part of our standard of what is beautiful. Beauty standards are cultural constructs, not &#39;nature&#39;. ",1
14391,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,More white guilt. Yawn.  It is what it is. She can still get any man she wants and fawned over and knows it so blame nature. Not being white. Folks are attracted to what they are attracted to.,1

14394,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,oh that poor woman! getting free stuff and ducking a police ticket realy gets to you. boo hoo!,1
14395,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was awesome!,1
14396,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hardcore truth,1
14397,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow... never thought of it this way. Interesting,1
14398,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I did not say that worrying about your looks &quot;makes&quot; you a model...,1
14399,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This made me very sad and appreciated of her brave speech. I wish her the best of luck in school and success in whatever she chooses to become, model or more likely honest politician we need!",1
14400,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Isn&#39;t that what she just did? She just outlined her privilege and gave an insider&#39;s description of that kind of privilege. I think you just looked at the title (which, is a little obnoxious without context) and dismissed it. It&#39;s actually more interesting than it initially appears.",1
14401,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There is no such think as one &quot;truth&quot;, only one &quot;face&quot; of it. Basing on that, she was speaking from her point of view and it&#39;s as honest as &quot;less atractive&quot;(?) person could put it. If you really worship truth in any way, move past stereotypes and try understand other people.",1
14402,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow. I am very humbled by her honesty.,1
14403,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s great. However, she needs to reformulate her message to get through to the people she is aiming for. A wonderful and very important message that needs clarity. ",1
14404,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not about this subject.,1
14405,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So are you saying that pretty women have no right to talk?,1
14406,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"When it comes to this subject yes her opinion matters less, she has no real perspective on it, all she can tell us is what we already know.",1
14407,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That was fantastic.
",1
14408,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I would,1
14409,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but that&#39;s exactly what she said! you just pretty much proved her entire point,1
14410,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"6:36 : &quot;I got these free things because of how I look like, not because of who I am&quot; There, she said it.

Next time, don&#39;t be such a judgemental moron",1
14411,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,When exactly did she say that being insecure and worrying about your looks makes you a model? She mentioned she was insecure to brush off the claims that being a model leads to nothing but happiness and confidence.,1
14412,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This one... just didn&#39;t really get to me. 

The part where she admits that she is &quot;insecure&quot; and has to &quot;think about what she looks like every day&quot;.. Well, I&#39;m insecure and think about what I look like several times a day (and because of the society we live in, this is a necessity..) BUT I am *not* a model and not even really &quot;attractive&quot;. She has good intentions and did well. It just didn&#39;t do anything for me. *shrug*",1
14413,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Actually, she was being very honest and enlightend about what she does and how it was possible, not only talking about the issues of the superficial society but also how that makes her privileged. In my oppinion she has less prejudice and enlightment about who she is and what she does that someone like you who jumps straight to assumptions. That being said, you should consider your own perspective and question how much of what you &quot;know&quot; about these issues.",1
14414,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,disney princess are rich and beautiful... and they want more.,1
14415,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,sweet girl,1
14416,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thats what she is trying to address. She has gained from so many people collectively agreeing that she is pretty and therefore deserves more. In a way its all of those people who only see her face and want what she has who create the foundation of what her and others in her profession profit from.,1
14417,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you obviously didn&#39;t watch any of that.,1
14418,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,@WorshipInTruth the truth is u need to listen before u type,1
14419,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,excellent,1
14420,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,just AMAZING talk...,1
14421,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Many people complain aboutthe title and misquote it. The title is not &quot;Looks do not matter.&quot; It&#39;s &quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything.&quot; Her talk is actually a lot about her looks that shaped her reality which seemed glamorous but wasn&#39;t always happy. She also talked about how innocent people were considered criminals because of their looks because looks matter in this society.
",1
14422,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nice.. sweat girl..,1
14423,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,An acknowledgment about the token efforts by the media on the definition of beauty vs the reality of what the media defines and constantly promotes as beautiful from a very intectual women (who happens to be the beneficiary of genetics and legacy)  who is a model. Thank you so much Cameron. &lt;3 you for your insight and courage to talk about the reality of modeling in our contemporary society.,1
14424,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So well put!,1
14425,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree. The thing is that the &quot;beauty&quot; industry is a multibillion industry. They  need to feed the vanity within, they need to make us sheep and insecure... thats how they will sell clothes, bags, shoes, cosmetics, magazines even dietary supplements... Its aaaaall for the money... sadly and unfortunately.  Thats why we need to teach our children and grow personalities... not &quot;princesses&quot;",1
14426,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Brilliant book from a brilliant writer!,1
14427,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The main problem with society today is people are sheep! We are raised from birth to think skinny is beautiful, money is power, and if you don&#39;t have those 2 important(supposedly important) things then your just.....a sheep!!! Life begins in the  womb and if WE ALL don&#39;t teach our kids From That Moment On, the importance of Love, Honesty, Respect, and Friendship, then this world and society will Never get better!!!
  ",1
14428,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,...but they sure help,1
14429,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i bet shes sexier than you ! ,1
14430,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Then why is she talking if she admitts that is the only reason she has that forum to begin with?,1
14431,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,*face palm* that&#39;s exactly what she&#39;s saying...,1
14432,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;She sat down next to him on the swing, in her nightgown, not slim the way girls get when they are not loved at seventeen, not fat the way women get when they&#39;re not loved at fifty, but absolutely right, a roundness, a firmness, the way women are at any age, he thought, when there is no question.&quot; (Leo Auffmann&#39;s perception of his wife, Lena, p46 of Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury)",1
14433,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i like how you dont have time to listen to her. then complain about her not saying things that she did say. can you imagine all the wrong impressions of people youve gotten because you wont listen. i bet 90% of the problems you have with people is you.,1
14434,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I do not have 10 minutes of my time to listen to tripe. People like her have absolutely no real perspective of the world. If she wanted to be honest she would admitt that she has had everything in the world (relationships, job offers etc) handed to her because she was an attractive female.",1
14435,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You cant agree with everything anyone says . But she had some good points,1
14436,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t know who that model is but she&#39;s very honest about her view on being white.,1
14437,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She considers herself &quot;Sexy&quot;???   LMFAO!!!,1
14438,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m disappointed at how many people are passing judgment here. Listen to what she&#39;s saying. As in &quot;independent contractor&quot; she basically putting her career on the line and it&#39;s quite possible that agencies could tell her to go to hell after saying these things on such a stage, but she has the courage to say what other models won&#39;t. And all this time I thought TEDsters were open-minded.",1
14439,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Maybe if you would give it a listen you would see that there&#39;s more to it than that and not judge her until you given what she has to say a little more objectivity. Based on your avatar and screen name I&#39;m guessing that you know the meaning of that saying about not being the first to cast stones. Open the shades to your glass house and take less than 10 minutes to see what she has to say instead of taking the same amount of time to judge her in the comments section.,1
14440,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah I want a bimbo supermodel to tell me why looks aren&#39;t important. Not gonna listen to this, does she at all seem to realize that her looks are the only reason she is up there talking to begin with?",1
14441,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I know a basketball player that was recruited at 15 years old because he was 6&#39;11&quot;.  He had never played the game before in his life.  I know a man that has mild autism who was born with a brain that was capable of doing college level math at 8 years old and now makes money most will only dream of because of it.  Should these people feel guilty because they were born with these gifts? Should we begrudge or shun their success? Or should they enjoy it and live life to its fullest unapologetically?,1
14442,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Guilt from success is a more destructive force than we are aware.,1
14443,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You obviously have not watched it to the end or listened carefully. ,1
14444,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To me she made her point quite clearly; in society, perception is reality and that perception can be based on physical beauty. She was acknowledging that she&#39;s been lucky in life because of her appearance. Meanwhile, pointing out the overwhelming disparity of non-white female models currently in the business, and how society uses appearance to form prejudices/pre-judgements. Many of the negative comments where apparently from people who could hear what she said, but failed to listen.",1

14446,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron is not arguing that &quot;looks aren&#39;t everything.&quot; The title is false, if not sarcastic. She is actually arguing the opposite. She is exposing how importan appearances and perception have been in crafting her career. She benefits from a world in which looks matter because she is deemed beautiful. However, she seeks to also expose how this mode of thinking is unfair &amp; offensive. The &quot;takeaway&quot; from her talk is that we all BEGIN acknowledging the extent to which appearances affect us.",1
14447,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She didn&#39;t say SHE believed white skin was beautiful, she said that is what the fashion industry considers beautiful and she benefits from that unfortunate belief.",1
14448,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Firstly this girl is stupid. she just disapproved her speech, and what she said at the start was racist.ONLY WHITE SKIN is considered beautiful. what bullshit
",1
14449,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Whoops! Looks like I clicked on the wrong TED speech. I meant to pull up Warren Buffett expaining how money doesn&#39;t really matter. Instead, I got Cameron telling me looks don&#39;t matter. No difference, really.",1
14450,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There is a market. She uses the market, although that doesn&#39;t mean she agrees with it.
Moreover, the evil of the market she works in comes mainly from the misunderstanding by the people that consume it.
Moreover, exiting the market, society has no racial bias still anymore, or not as much at least, but there is still a lot of beauty bias.
Sometimes things are not what you thing they are, but you need to have them to know that.",1
14451,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What I think all of those people are trying to say, is that, after you have had the experience (not job, of course, on the other comment, I think that one is a little bit out) you realize it is nothing special or of real value. This is, after you have had beauty, money, fame whatever,you get that it is all superficial. This is not to say, if you are a monster and everybody looks at you judgementaly or if you can&#39;t eat, that of course is not the case I&#39;m refering to",1
14452,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s about articulating a problem so it becomes more tangent and thus people can go about it more concretely. ,1
14453,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Guys say whatever women want to hear, alot of girls want to be told they are beautiful, they need it.. and it works.
If focusing on womens personality would work to get a girl to like you that&#39;s what guys would do, but that&#39;s not what works.",1
14454,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Funny how most comments are being made about how looks DO matter...when that is actually the point she was making the entire time.  Don&#39;t get caught on the title.,1
14455,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I never said those stats where made up, I agree there is a problem, but this &#39;looks aren&#39;t everything&#39; point that she&#39;s made has been made 1,000,000+ times in the past, nothing will change without a distancing from the status quo/some sort of shift in social consciousness, in my honest opinion.",1

14459,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i agree with u she isent all that prety she would have hired her 4 her body and just told her she was pretty as i said ive seen better that arnt models,1
14460,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,shes a bit up her self as she referse to her se as pretty she  is nothing grate ive seen way better,1
14461,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I know she makes valid points, but I can&#39;t help feel she&#39;s being taken more seriously because of her looks and poise. What she&#39;s saying is sensible but not ground breaking-did she actually say something we didn&#39;t already know? &#39;I worry about my looks everyday.&#39; I know! You&#39;re a woman-we all do! Because that&#39;s how we&#39;re judged! And pointing it out makes no difference AT ALL, except for the speakers bank balance. I bet everyone here applauding her will STILL judge people unfairly by thier looks.",1
14462,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You sad individual. This is very important stuff and if you can&#39;t see it, go back to your sweaty computer game and keep your dim opinions to yourself.",1
14463,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s sad but not entirely surprising to see that 97% of the commenters here have ENTIRELY missed the point of what this woman is saying.,1
14464,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Not all models are attractive,1
14465,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Awesome...
Took courage to open herself out like that.. :)",1
14466,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&gt;eyeroll&lt; another super-model sob story. ,1
14467,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not really, though I can understand why some might see that as the reason. I just felt that, compared to other TEDtalks, this one lacked some volume of content? ",1
14468,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Well said. I think she totally misses the point. Girls are always going to be trying to obtain that ideal of what they see in magazines and on television. Russel has shown no real insight here. Is she quitting modelling? No. She reminds me of a lot of rich people who basically go out there and say the general population should not aspire to achieve what the likes of Russel already have.  Its easy to say that when you have a few million in the bank.,1
14469,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are pathetic. ,1
14470,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;don&#39;t be a part of it&quot; - Maybe she could speak out about the problem? Oh wait...,1
14471,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Amazing comment. Very powerful and true. ,1
14472,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So... is she still a model at the present moment?,1
14473,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why???!!!,1
14474,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i&#39;ve the looks and i know its important..ive money and i know its imp,,same goes for the job ;)",1
14475,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s awesome that she began this conversation -- but I think her speech ended right at the point where it should have began.,1
14476,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"hmm so she&#39;s one of the models that have the other half of women screaming bulimia, anorexia etc etc. Don&#39;t want to be part of the problem, then don&#39;t be part of it. ",1
14477,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,5:31 - 6:24  Definitely my favorite segment of the talk.  The photo juxtaposition was really powerful.,1
14478,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But that was the entire point of this lecture.  She is basically saying &quot;I&#39;m sorta-glad I&#39;m privileged,  but I&#39;m still sad that women are oppressed&quot;  Lol. I You need to think more critically of what your hearing.",1
14479,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yes math is an ability you are born with, not something you learn. Grate work there!",1
14480,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What a brutal lecture. Just goes to show.. Standing in your underwear for a living is just that,1
14481,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"well being a model  is not just being skinny and have shiny hair,  Russell has the most beautiful face i have ever seen, that helps a lot, but it doesn&#39;t help little girls who grows up with these kind of standards... I&#39;m grateful thought about this talk. thank you",1
14482,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Fabulous talk! Gutsy, honest, raw. A gift.",1
14483,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great talk, thank you, could tell how nervous you were.

14484,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she was really honest about herself and the subject in general. In a sense, this makes you reflect specially about the bittersweet part that she said at the end about receiving all these things but not exactly being happy. ",1
14485,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is YT. I think a lot of it is projection.,1
14486,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,the picture she showed of her first photoshoot and who she was broke my heart.,1
14487,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,My problem with this talk is that I learned nothing.,1

However, the honesty, and the message was a pleasent surprise.  I have been out with my (girl) friends and guys will walk right up to the most attractive girl and say: &quot;You are so beautiful,&quot; as if that is the single most significant &amp; profound statement uttered by man.

14494,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Did you actually listen to the talk? The point was that chasing an artificial, socially constructed (and rather ridiculous) ideal of beauty and perfection will not guide you to happiness, but rather increase the insecurities and guilt for being unable to fully appreciate and be grateful for the things you have, especially those which are just a result of chance and not hard work.",1
14495,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"From what I gathered, I believe the point she was trying to put across wasn&#39;t that she is more than a pretty face, but that behind what is so often perceived as an image of perfection lies a huge deal of insecurities and hidden worries, and that we should try to see those aspects too. You can tell that it can&#39;t have been easy for her to say that despite being one of the greatest beneficiaries of it, nothing about being the socially accepted image of perfection makes her happy.",1

14504,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I know. I was using that as an example of what I meant...,1
14505,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ps. no one ever measures intelligence on ones IQ score.,1
14506,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Don&#39;t worry I have been there done that and walked out a better person, what I did and what many people do is take it personally and do something about it, you would be surprised how many people say the exact same things, we all want &quot;more&quot; but there are somethings that cant be changed only improved, I for one am not a quitter and often I am to stubborn for my own good, it has been a double edge sword, now its an quality not an burden I took care of my self and MADE me better.
You can to!",1
14507,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well, yes, intelligence can be measured differently. I was referring to the &quot;smarts&quot; she was, like the logical, academic type, like how you&#39;d measure an IQ test or something.

That&#39;s the problem. I&#39;ve been depressed for years. So I never feel good enough, smart enough, pretty enough, whatever. Although I can tell you for sure I&#39;m far from &quot;beautiful&quot; even with a normal person&#39;s standards. ",1

How do you say one is smart while the other is not...

Isn&#39;t it more of an fact that you are to afraid to try something new, to find your strengths....I can almost promise you that if you were happy with your self you would not want to be more smart/beautiful.
No one is telling you to be something you aren&#39;t, that&#39;s only you. ",1
14512,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I know exactly what you mean! Actually, on top of that, most &quot;average&quot; or &quot;ugly&quot; people don&#39;t even have your intelligence. I&#39;m in the awkward &quot;above average&quot; category where I&#39;m &quot;smart&quot; but want more smarts because it&#39;s not quite good enough... and then I&#39;m ugly and want to be beautiful. And while logically I would choose the intelligence over the beauty, there&#39;s always that part that just wishes for once someone would find me pretty. So I&#39;m in the awkward spot where I&#39;m jealous of both... :(",1
14513,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What a pointless talk. She&#39;s basically a hypocrite, everything she has in life is due to her looks and winning the &quot;genetic lottery&quot; including her appearance there at TED. I guess her point was to prove she&#39;s more than just a pretty face, not to judge her by her looks, and try to give herself and the superficial world of fashion some depth. Big Fail.",1
14514,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What to take from this ; people are shallow for the most part (police story), people should be ashamed of being shallow and woman other idols not models or actors and sadly that is rare, In science class I maybe heard a womans name once (Marie Curie), so girls of today lead the girls of tmr :) ",1

We all are born into a &quot;class&quot; but some of us choose to rise above that and aim a little higher, saying you can be a president may-be over doing it but the message is the same, how we where born does not decide how we live, beauty, intelligence, confidence all those things are well....... attractive some we can effect others we cant....make the best of it and reach for your dreams not vague ideas about superficial traits we only want because we don&#39;t have them our self.

In fact I love her in they way she seems so well spoken and smart.  If I would meet her I would probably fall in love with her, wish I could meet someone like her.",1

14532,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"what a great topic and presentation; a very important one definitely worth talking about.  i felt it couldve been taken more in-depth though.  id love to hear an expanded version of this idea from her in a few years from now.  i find it great anytime when a person from a perceived status in life, whether privileged or underprivileged, finds a way to articulate their thoughts and feelings enabling a connection to the opposite side. after all, we&#39;re all humans first and foremost.

14542,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wait. She really didn&#39;t go anywhere with that talk. Basically, she said &quot;I live a privileged lifestyle but women and minorities are oppressed.&quot;  You&#39;re a woman, living in the upper echelons of privilege in society and you&#39;re saying your gender is oppressed?

14544,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i&#39;ve seen plenty of women/men remark on the looks on men on this site. it&#39;s a natural thing to do and i don&#39;t have a problem with it as long as it&#39;s not aggressive or demeaning.,1

We now live in a society were sexual objectification has become such a normal thing, it&#39;s not recognised as that any more. Which is why so many girls/women have low self-esteem and sometimes feel the need for female competition.",1

14552,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She hot,1
14553,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m sorry but she&#39;s a bit weak.  ,1

14556,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s ugly though. ,1
14557,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah.. sorry but she still looks hot as fuck when she puts on the long dress and sweater. Didn&#39;t really change my  view of how much I would like to bang her. ,1
14558,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&gt;Majority go the bad way but that doesn&#39;t mean all of them do.
Good answer. I&#39;ve had several women throwing themselves at me over the years whom I thought must have ulterior motives because they were too pretty. Hmm, hope I didn&#39;t hurt their feelings too badly when I didn&#39;t respond. ",1

14560,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&gt;I can say this as an ugly teen.

What success I have, I built for myself. The friends I have hang out with me because of me rather than my money or looks. So who was the lucky one? My sister&#39;s early life was luxury and pampering when I had to work, but the success I have now is due to my own work.
My fat geeky teenage years, my years of being a social outcast, all forced me to become a level headed, hard working, fair minded and loyal to my friends. So who was the lucky one?",1
14561,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&gt;I can say this as an ugly teen.
It sucked being in her shadow as a kid. I had to work for every bit of success and acceptance in society while she had it all handed to her on a silver platter.
Now though, she&#39;s in poverty and still has a totally self centered narcissistic personality and wonders why no one likes her anymore. On the other hand I enjoy the success that my hard won skills have brought me. Oh I&#39;m no millionaire but I have a rock steady career that brings in about 70k a year.",1
14562,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&gt;I can say this as an ugly teen.
I know the feeling. I was an ugly teen too. I also have an older sister who was beautiful and very popular in her youth. She never had to strive to develop career or even a decent personality because of that beauty. She went through her 20&#39;s, 30&#39;s, living off men who couldn&#39;t wait to support her. She went from marriage to marriage until nature pulled the rug out from under her a while back. Now she&#39;s nobody, no looks, no money, and no personality.",1
14563,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If she &quot;falls in love&quot; with an average or even ugly guy - loving him for who HE really IS than I will believe her. But we all know what&#39;s gonna happen...,1
14564,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks are important, I can say this as an ugly teen. It&#39;s easy for a model to say they&#39;re not - it&#39;s like some billionaire telling an impoverished family money isn&#39;t everything.  I have seen the favours beauty provides to the winners of the only lottery worth winning - genetics. ",1
14565,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Dude - I must be the 19 year old you. Having the same experience, but not as comfortable in my own skin",1

14568,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Nope... she has thousands of men wanting to fuck her, and use her as a trophy to brag about to his friends. The truth is that you are the only person that can make you happy. Learn to accept yourself. Be at peace. Change your mindset. Let yourself be naturally kind and funny without expecting nothing in return. People will begin to flock to you.",1
14569,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cut the crap there are lots of kind and or desperate men who aren&#39;t overly critical and would love to have a girlfriend. I&#39;d like to ask you why do so many women develop an unrealistic obsession about subjective beauty standards? Why if its so hyped are women stressing its importance?

Incidentally men have their own insecurities but they appear to embrace and control them better. Insecurities that range from facial hair, height, penis size and muscles. Frankly i think women need a reality check",1
14570,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very moving and honest.,1
14571,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I didn&#39;t hear a word she said.My mind was going &quot;YES SHE IS SO PRETTY&quot; hahahah,1
14572,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I like the type of women in King Magazine!,1
14573,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"that is an interesting point of view ...

14574,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Make sure you have the volume on next time you watch a video,1
14575,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think the point of this talk went riiiight over your head.,1
14576,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,thats somuch well said nd ur message was quite inspiringgg,1
14577,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well, when gisele bunduchen gives a powerful analysis of our societal values on Ted, I MIGHT reconsider. ",1

And once you start enjoying life, the friends you make along the way will love you too. And as we speak, there is probably a sad boy who feels just like you and when you both overcome your sadness, you&#39;ll find each other. And once you find him, those thousands of men won&#39;t matter at all. Just be careful though and find something you love.",1
14580,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&gt;To me she is not really Preety, I Find NOTHING attractive in this &#39;BEAUTIFUL&#39; model.

Ba ha ha ha ha! LOL ROFLOL!",1
14581,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"for most of the women, good looking means everything, you know....",1
14582,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I have mad respect for this young lady,1
14583,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Great talk and quite brave I think.,1
14584,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,looks are everything.,1
14585,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,an ugly person cant call themselves a good looking person,1
14586,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what the hell you cant be a model and be smart and funny you only get one damn it.  man its just not fair lol. ,1
14587,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Maybe this happens cause cause you&#39;re more focused on your own looks than you are of other people.
",1
14588,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There&#39;s also a lot of argument over whether intelligence is genetic or learned. People learn the determination to follow their dreams from a good upbringing with positive role models.
And also, people perception of success is subjective, so who&#39;s to decide what&#39;s more worthy than something else? ",1
14589,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"WTF
",1
14590,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very informative video. Thank you :),1
14591,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Absolutely retarded advice. You cannot magically will other people to find you attractive by your state of mind. A woman judges a man&#39;s appearance within 3-5 seconds of first seeing him. This idea that your inner thoughts will be reflected back to the world is pure subjectivist mystical tripe. Get with reality. All you people who come up with these idiotic theories have no clue what it&#39;s like in the world for someone with below average looks. ,1
14592,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The only problem is, other people can&#39;t do &quot;anything they want.&quot;  You have to win a different genetic lottery--usually the brain one--in order to invent the next internet, become the next President of the US (in that case, a brain wired for the highest level of Machiavellian politics), and lots of other things considered more worthy than modelling. ",1
14593,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Interesting. I was an ugly fat geek as a teenager and I learned not to give a rip about how I look. 19 years as a heavy diesel truck mechanic improved my appearance but I still have the freedom of just being able to throw on a pair of jeans and T shirt and feel perfectly comfortable in public. I don&#39;t need to waste a bunch of money on a fancy car because it&#39;s not going to help anyway. ,1
14594,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Isn&#39;t the point not to care whether others think you&#39;re the shit or not? ,1
14595,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Youtube started buffering at 5:00 for me, haha.",1
14596,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,to pay for college :) ,1
14597,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I have a stunning looking Stepdaughter ( I have no claim there). At about thirty she had a car accident and got a scar on her face. She refused surgery to fix it. She said it was a relief to be normal looking person at last.,1
14598,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,All i have learned is that looks totally matter and models have an easy job and get tons of perks because they are good looking which is mostly attributable to genetics. Thanks for the talk.,1
14599,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Also, sorry, would you see it as liberating for a black man to cover himself up in a non-black neighbourhood if suffering from racism? Or, would you think it would be better and fairer if racism just didn&#39;t exist in the first place. 

Why create a world in which men sexualise women, so have women cover themselves. Where&#39;s the freedom in that? Why not just make men sexualise less when creating in the first place? It&#39;d be fairer, surely  and freer.",1
14600,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If it were true that the content of character were recognised, then one wouldn&#39;t have to cover themselves up from the gaze of men. After all, if it is an order, then order men not to sexualise. It&#39;s made too easy for men to get away with sexualising and women being subject to that. The religion shows its bias toward men when it orders women to cover themselves, when men could simply look away and beyond if they were pure in thought.",1
14601,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Secondly, if an appropriately dressed Muslim woman was judged by her character, and not by her attire, or her attributes, wouldn&#39;t Muslim women have risen in status? From my view, in Muslim countries, the women seem to be of exceptional character to persevere in the face of oppression, yet still they are treated poorly. 

Again, I mean no disrespect. But before exalting your own beliefs above others, you should examine them to make sure they are not just as easily criticised. ",1
14602,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"With all due respect to your faith, &#39;ordered&#39; and &#39;liberation&#39; are not concepts that mix, unless some sort of choice is involved. And unless men are also ordered to cover up, a Muslim woman is STILL being judged by her physical attributes. Because it is those selfsame attributes that decide what she is and is not allowed to wear. ",1
14603,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think you have an overly optimistic view of the world in general. While I commend you for being one of those reasonably educated and attentive people you speak of, this IS a notable insight for the world in general. The average woman DOES think she&#39;d be happier and more content if she was pretty enough to be a model. 

And really, how often does anyone record or take seriously things models say in non-professional settings? ",1
14604,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s making a point and shes not racist.,1
14605,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But yet, is not free to choose how to dress. If your appreciation is such, then all followers of your particular type of Islam should cover up fully, including men.",1
14606,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"From the Islamic point of view, liberated women  who must often worry about their looks, figure, and youth for the pleasure of others  are trapped in a form of slavery.

Videos like these deepen my appreciation to Allah Almighty&#39;s order to women to cover up in Islam. The liberation of the Muslim woman is that she is recognized by the content of her character rather than by the display of her physical attributes. 
",1
14607,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"and also, I think their are plenty of those who haven&#39;t thought of the things she talks about, even after years of social commentary and satire. And depending on your definition of being educated, you&#39;d might agree that you can too be educated and still fall for the superficial images and beauty. After all, its not just the media or film or fashion, its a part of human nature.",1
14608,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s a fair point you make. I felt she didn&#39;t speak of anything groundbreaking as well but she did manage to bring a bit of earnest and honesty to the discussion. I don&#39;t know the industry that well, and can&#39;t comment on the amount of models who are willing to come out to a public speaking forum and express their opinions on their behalf. That being said, its important to have people like her come out to the public. We shouldn&#39;t forget that these people exist and see them as a waste of time.",1
14609,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good talk.,1
14610,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I was encouraged to be a president. Of something. Or a genius. And this is what they want women to be? What kind of society is this?,1
14611,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How ignorant of you to say that.,1
14612,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s an impressive talk!
",1
14613,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I agree with you 100% in the last 6 months of my life all I&#39;ve changed is my attitude and my life is the complete opposite of what it use to be (in a good way),1
14614,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If she believes all this...why is she still modeling? ,1
14615,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well, even if you are just intelligent you could make money  (&gt;power) if you wanted and after all money is probably the only attribute besides looks that will make people love you (yes they will do it for the money, but models are also just loved for the looks, so not that much of a difference). Focus on different things, because you will need to work hard, probably harder than you would with good looks, but finally you are alone and can afford to work much harder than those beauties ever could.",1
14616,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"However, you must be careful that you don&#39;t start becoming arrogant. Physical appearance is a dangerous topic, and entering it you must be cautious. You are still correct though.",1
14617,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The fact is, is that, true inspiring, interesting and fulfilling people to be around have always been the freaks and weirdos who do shit just because they truly get that burning uplifting feeling in their guts. Models are not creative, are abused and preyed upon by photographers, often sexually ( Uhem, Terry Richardson, Uhem), have about maybe 3 years of work  if they are lucky and then are looked as being &#39;Last Season&quot;. They churn out Russian 14 year old&#39;s like dolls and totally fuck them up. ",1
14618,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Anyone who lives in New York and has spent any amount of time around girl and guy models, and the social scene that surrounds them know that they and their industry are the worst mind numbing, brain dead vapid, soul crushing, anti human group of people that are NOT to be admired. Models, promoters, clubs, are nothing but empty black holes of horrible people. Trust me. The real story should not be about the fake image but just how much they suck at life. ",1
14619,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was so awesome!  I hope more girls (and guys) watch this video it&#39;s so honest.,1
14620,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"sigh, i bet her look play a major role in receiving many attention. most ppl are superficial, unfortunately.",1
14621,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Closet pedophiles?,1
14622,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Then being a model and talking about how image is nothing is a hypocrisy. She lives off her looks. People PURCHACE her looks. ,1
14623,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m going to agree with 0CAUTION0 on this because as a guy I&#39;ve never dated anyone as a result of how they look. Every girl I&#39;ve asked out have a specific character trait that draws me towards them. And sure there are the occasional pretty looking ladies that draw the eye but it doesn&#39;t go any where beyond that, for me at least. That&#39;s all good evidence that sexual attraction from image is on a different category than sexual attraction from love (emotional attachment). ",1
14624,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I wear burlap and refuse to shave.

But Ms. Russell is a professional model, and when you&#39;re beautiful for a living, a certain amount of showiness not only becomes a habit, but even a part of who you are.  The kind of people who value this message the most highly aren&#39;t receptive to that, I think...... but that&#39;s not who she&#39;s talking to.",1

14639,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If people think this talk is a waste of time then, with all due respect, they really haven&#39;t learnt how to spend it to begin with. Image is superficial and yet image is everything in our society. Image is not just looks and the lottery, its also the little stuff like perception.
It maybe fake but its exactly how it is. People who can manipulate and leverage their image hav all the advantages we can imagine. Ms. Russell&#39;s honest was refreshing and brilliant.
BTW: the swimwear campaign trolled it.",1
14640,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Image is powerful but it usually has unseen cost and benefits. I&#39;m glad she was able to point out the costs that other humans pay for not meeting an unfair image that they have no control in creating and also understanding the benefits she received were not gain through work or knowledge but by simple birth. I admit i clicked on this talk because of her looks and i also assumed that it would be intellectually barren. My own assumptions of her show the cost and benefits of image,1
14641,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not at all -- she was being brutally honest. I&#39;ve been in the fashion industry for about 10 years, myself,in one capacity or another, and have seen it everywhere. Actually, of all the models I&#39;ve met in my life, the LEAST insecure were the men and women of colour, which is great. &quot;Pretty white girls&quot; are a dime a dozen, as she points out, yet the beautiful women and men of colour who DO get scouted have much less competition, ergo they know they&#39;ll get bookings by designers who aren&#39;t ...stupid.",1
14642,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sorry, &quot;she has.&quot; My mind was going in three places at once. :)",1
14643,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Actually, you has terrific facial bone structure, excellent symmetry, and in the Fashion Industry having a flat chest is a GOOD thing. No, let me take that back -- it&#39;s WONDERFUL! Models are called &quot;human clothes hangers&quot; for a reason. When you do High Fashion and Runway, you *can&#39;t* have a bosom, really. The clothes won&#39;t drape right. She does High Fashion and Runway, ergo a flat chest is mandator, whereas I&#39;ve seen models with FAR less attractive faces. Faces aren&#39;t that important, honestly.",1
14644,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;ll give you a very simple answer to an incredibly complex topic that you&#39;ve raised: Money. It&#39;s a job, and like any other job, it brings with it concerns, issues, and scrutiny. I listen to people complain about their jobs constantly; people who make far less money than she. I don&#39;t say &quot;career,&quot; because UNlike other paths, there is a finite ending. Sure, you can Botox it away for a few extra years, but it still ends. Fashion is a career -- modelling is NOT. So, you cash in while you still can.",1
14645,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"BRILLIANT talk! And blatantly honest. First of all, to those that scoff at her insecurities, she&#39;s 100% correct. I&#39;m one of the top models (and women in beauty period) with a disability in THE WORLD, and my cousin is also a model (runway). We do nothing but worry about our looks. When those are gone, we better have backup. Luckily, I do, but when I was obese, I NEVER got the same treatment that I do now, even in a wheelchair. It&#39;s ludicrous. In my own life I&#39;ve seen the shocking difference.",1
14646,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Seriously, its just another form of prostitution!",1
14647,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oh please, its almost as if she wants us to feel sorry for her.  Poor rich white girl who cashes in on the system, on racism, on objectification of women while laughing at people&#39;s superficiality all the way to the bank.  Oh poor lil girl who&#39;s so insecure, yeah right!",1
14648,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Basically, it makes it super unfair for the rest of us who are born short and brown and who men generally dis and dump for the blonde, tall.....or even in hopes of the blonde, we are mistreated, undervalued and treated like second scraps.  ITS JUST SO UNFAIR especially when it comes to power of money.  Such a bunch of bullshit in our societal values.",1
14649,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Fantastic talk... well, done. If that does not inspire someone they were not listening.
",1
14650,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She talked very very well. That is a REAL model for me, a model for the society to be inspired!",1
14651,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she didnt say she didnt deserve it. shes just saying how so many young girls and people in general are so concerned about their looks. how looks can give you advantages less attractive ppl cant get. how looks and its legacy are just plain aesthetics. its only fitting that a model talks about this.,1
14652,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"beauty and brains, she really did win the lottery...
",1
14653,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I totally have so much respect for her for having the courage to come up and talk about this.,1
14654,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I absolutely commend her for coming up and voicing her views like that. However, i feel she could have really made a lasting impact w/ her argument. So basically she&#39;s saying; im stunning but i should not have gotten what i did (just) because i&#39;m beautiful??. this argument is as old as time; fashion industry vs reality. Nonetheless, im glad she&#39;s trying",1
14655,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"good girl :)
",1
14656,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"you&#39;re wrong, many people might like you more than her just because she is pretty doesn&#39;t mean much, there are lots of pretty women",1
14657,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"IMO, the real problem isn&#39;t that there are these biases already in place. The problem is that we are addicted to them to the point where acknowledging they are there is painfully easy. She seems simplistic and juvenile, telling us that we have to acknowledge beauty&#39;s role even more, when acknowledging it&#39;s role is the very act that gives &quot;beauty&quot; its power. honestly its just depressing to think that people are actually impressed by what she says. It&#39;s so obvious.",1
14658,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She claims we should all take more time to think about how looks influence power dynamics. Really, we spend too much time thinking about that; in fact, this is the reason why beauty is so powerful. So thinking about how true it is will only make it more of a problem. People can&#39;t handle the fact that beauty is subjective so they make one group of lookalikes the supermodels. She is telling us to think more about a societal ill that is already too deeply ingrained to shed via simple articulation.",1
14659,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,sure looks arent everything. but youve got everything i need (ie. looks),1
14660,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Love that she did this.  Wish I had really digested and absorbed more expressions of these points when I was younger.  I feel like so much of myself and my life (only 23 now) was lost to crippling self-loathing, and my all-time most ingrained issue is probably my appearance.  I really respect that she got this message out into the world!",1
14661,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You are all over the place, missing the point entirely.  Failing horribly at a weak strawman argument.  Try this tautology, being called eduTouY increases your chances of association with the KKK and first positing societal white bias as being perceived, then self evident, affirms bias with snide xenophobic confidence.",1
14662,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wait, I don&#39;t understand why people think her talk is a waste of time. Image IS superficial, and all human beings buy into image, beauty and the like. We&#39;re constantly bombarded with it and we tend to not recognize it, especially young women. I think its important that we have a fashion model who is willing to express the fact that all of it is fake on some level. She spoke intelligently and clearly without saying anything dumb headed. The opposite of the fashion model cliche IMO.",1
14663,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,9 minutes of bragging and other crap . can i have my 8 minutes back . dont give a fuck ,1
14664,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree. Who gets more &quot;doors&quot; open.... a pudgy, unattractive woman of any race or a hot, sexy woman of any race??? 
 ",1
14665,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Boils down to white guilt... nope.  She is talking about her looks, being white is part of that but not all of it.  She could be not white and beautiful and retain a lot of social advantages.  Being a hot white women opens a lot of doors and a lot of invitations, to agree otherwise is just plain idiotic.  Societal bias for white people is so obvious one doesn&#39;t really expect to contend with the issue except for on youtube, a breeding ground for meritocratic white people.",1
14666,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m getting a bunch of responses to my post.  Some like this ... and while i completely understand what you just wrote and tend to agree ... however, my comment was in response to a very open statement that i think people are taking in very different ways ... i was simply responding to it literally.",1
14667,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But race is defined as having distinct physical characteristics, so the way we look is determined by our race is it not? I do not think the two are independent of one another.",1
14668,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I wish she had not turned it into a race issue and simple left it as a looks issue. But I guess its eaiser to fight racism than it is to fight &quot;uglyism&quot;----,1
14669,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&#39;Here&#39;s me...here&#39;s me...here&#39;s me...here&#39;s me...&#39; That&#39;s all we need to learn from her. ,1

14675,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s an honest talk overall. Very good. But I really dislike the &quot;you can be anything you want&quot; stuff. Such nonsense. If you are born into a ghetto you are fucked. If you are born with average intelligence or no innate creativity you will not be an inventor. And regarding &quot;you can be President of the US&quot; comment, no you can&#39;t. There have been hundreds of millions of Americans in 250 years and only 44 were President. It is such nationalistic mythological hogwash. How does anyone buy that shit.",1
14676,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for reiterating the most boring clich there is. Pretty people do not suffer under pressure? They don&#39;t have to work hard and develop character? Beautiful people are born with a big fat advantage over ugly people. Period. No need to come up with sorry excuses that there is somehow still a level playing field. The same applies to intelligence or being born into a good family. Life is fundamentally unfair in that regard.  ,1
14677,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Fit,1
14678,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You need to learn critical thinking skills and to stop taking everything at face value.,1
14679,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It isn&#39;t everything but it sure got you through life! (Not to say you wouldn&#39;t have if you weren&#39;t pretty). But you basically said winning the lottery isn&#39;t everything because having more money does not necessarily equate to happiness, which is a dumb argument. Fyi, you looked pretty in all your pictures even when you were trying to look bad.",1
14680,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Very true,1
14681,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But beauty is a perspective and reality of a give time and space. Poverty is also based on a system that can be modified to eliminate the negative impacts. Not all realities are given. Some rely on culture and values.,1
14682,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What is the reality that a female individual has to deal with if she has all the &quot;right&quot; attributes for our definition of sexy/beautiful? The reality is you are an object. Men may have no interest in who you are, only what they want from you, which involves you being just an object. In crude terms, you are meat to be devoured. Try remaining true to yourself but gaining 90lbs and see if it&#39;s still you they want. To aspire to be a model is to aspire to kill your soul. That vacant look says object.",1
14683,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To be honest, I know a lot of pretty girls I wouldn&#39;t ever date because they just have such an incompatible personality to me. When someone is still in the teen years, looks are almost everything. Seriously it pretty much is and that can be psychologically harmful for them when they get older, but eventually guys start to realise that looks are only a bonus.

And really, clothing, hair style, make up, etc. can make a big difference. Fat? Diet and exercise - not easy, but maybe worth it.",1
14684,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"As a Man I do admire a Womans beauty, but we shouldnt praise them to much becuese like she said they were just lucky to be born with the right genes, it was a totaly acident, and we shouldnt be encourging little girls to become models, models dont do any good for society, much better to train attractive women to be scientists and wear lab coats.",1
14685,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,if you think love has to do with looks then you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,1
14686,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I didnt like this one, shes nervous and you can hear  it clearly on her voice. Sincere perhaps but a tedtalk should be interesting plus here voice makes me sleepy and im not tired at all. The smile ted talk is my favourite-- short and full of quality ",1
14687,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,her openness is refreshing.,1
14688,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i am amazed by this person.,1
14689,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What she says is &quot;awkward&quot; and perhaps ironically crude. But it is true, and although one hopes she genuinely values what she is saying, these issues are often silently ignored especially where they matter most.

Fortunately or unfortunately she, being beautiful, is in a position to raise this and make us actually think about it: I say this because we have all been told by the average person or our parents that looks don&#39;t matter.",1
14690,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good on her, She was highlighting some of the things we already know but don&#39;t often think about enough. Yeah it&#39;s easy for her to say, but she got up on stage and said her piece with sincere belief.  Too many people say it&#39;s easy for her but you&#39;re missing the point.",1

14695,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,the sad truth in modern day society huh?,1
14696,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what sorcery is this,1
14697,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Honestly this isn&#39;t new to anyone, is it? Pretty white girls get stuff for free, people smile at them all the time wherever they are, they pay less everywhere, and they&#39;re often insecure about how they look. I&#39;m a white young man and I&#39;m insecure about how I look as well, even though I&#39;m not ugly, and people don&#39;t smile at me all the time nor give me discounts at all. I knew all of this!",1
14698,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I wish she would&#39;ve elaborated on how only 3% of American women fit the category for the current perception of beauty, and even less for men, and how it&#39;s only going to get worse.",1
14699,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Intelligence is attractive, but i&#39;ll be honest, if she wasn&#39;t physically attractive i would not have even watched this video!",1
14700,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One of the points was that the talk was hard for her, and that she was insecure.  I think you might have missed a point along the way.",1

What you see in your mirror in the morning is less than 5 % of who you really are . You will never understand what and why of what happened to Karen Carpenter and so many peoples murders &amp; suicides each year in the illusion of beauty. ",1
14705,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Brilliant!,1
14706,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I guess I&#39;ll be the only one to say she&#39;s really not that attractive,1
14707,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow Cameron very well spoken and she seem very well informed educated and super nice i really like the message this was good,1
14708,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,And you are as stupid and ugly as dirt with your magazines open looking at the pictures of the models !!!,1
14709,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The real point is that almost everyone in the world is insecure. There are also a few who are confident and some of these even include people that aren&#39;t the best looking. The point is that the way we look almost plays no role in how good we feel about ourselves (unless you are severely unattractive because of an illness or a disability). It&#39;s about coming to peace with how we look and owning it. we just have to be comfortable in our own skin despite what others say or think. ,1
14710,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,that was the point. ,1
14711,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what? beauty = intelligence? ever heard of the halo effect?,1
14712,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;They don&#39;t just go away just because we in the 21st century say they&#39;re not fair.&quot;

This is true. At the end of the day men like what they like, whether it&#39;s biological, culturally influenced, or hell, just plain irrational. Same goes for women and what they like. 

And to clarify, I don&#39;t like pointing to media (or anything) as the some bugbear source of problems, I&#39;m too existential for that. How  much media affects culture vs. how much it reflects culture is a matter I find very intriguing.",1
14713,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Entertaining to watch. Seems like a genuinely nice person. Sad that the culture is obsessed with image. True appreciation of the special uniqueness of human beings will cure it. But one day we will all look like super beings, due to genetic programming.",1
14714,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,One case of a woman who is beautiful and intelligent serves as evidence of that claim?,1
14715,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Nice.,1
14716,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron adds evidence to something that she left out -- beautiful women are usually above average in intelligence, something which flies in the face of a rather common stereotype. ",1
14717,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But of the two traits you mention, one (red lips) wasn&#39;t mentioned in the talk at all, and the other (thinness) has not been culturally universal throughout history at all. Full-bodied women has been idealized as fertile and desirable in past cultures just as thin-bodied women are idealized in contemporary Western society. Evolutionary psychology clearly doesn&#39;t tell the whole story.",1
14718,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That&#39;s a very good point, Vanguard.  We&#39;re human beings, and can go beyond our hard wiring.  I&#39;m just saying, the mainstream media do a lot of bad things, but they really can&#39;t be blamed for these stereotypes which evolved over thousands of years.  They don&#39;t just go away just because we in the 21st century say they&#39;re not fair.  It does disturb me that the mainstream media&#39;s portrayals of what is &quot;ideal&quot; is becoming increasingly narrow, while real women come in all shapes &amp; sizes.",1
14719,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"sixteen people lack brains, figuratively ",1
14720,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"While I agree that evolutionary factors undergird what people find attractive, the wonderful/hideous thing about humans is that we&#39;re not merely products of evolution. Somehow, I don&#39;t buy that desire of flat stomach has to do with women not looking pregnant so much as it is about general nubile fitness. But that&#39;s beside the point. My point is, there&#39;s a case to be made for the imposition and mutability of sexual and aesthetic appeal (apart from evolutionary factors) through custom and media.",1
14721,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"...Also.
Not a bad deconstruction, but it&#39;s like Inception - it needs to go deeper. I agree with the opinion that she...demurred from divulging the nature of her insecurities, only volunteering that even pretty models like herself she has some, which is news to no one. It would have been nice to hear more on that. As it is, it&#39;s more affirmation than revelation.

Also, personally, my opinion of her wasn&#39;t &quot;transformed&quot; when she changed her outfit; it was rendered when she opened her mouth.

14724,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s a superficial treatment of the topic. There are evolutionary reasons for men&#39;s preferences. I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re fair or noble, but the media did not cut them from whole cloth. A flat stomach meant a woman was not pregnant, which meant she was ready to be impregnated. Full lips meant she wasn&#39;t malnourished; red, moist lips were a further sign of health as well as sexual arousal. These preferences are many millenia old, not merely 200 years as she says.",1
14725,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really don&#39;t find her that attractive. Making a career out of people taking pictures of you isn&#39;t that enthralling. More repugnant really.,1
14726,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"All just a little too obvious...not really bad...but cliche.

14733,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"...I was actually pretty artistically gifted as a kid. And I still am. Granted, none of that talent came from my parents, BUT they&#39;re encouragement is what kept me practicing and developing that talent. There&#39;s nothing wrong with telling kids that the sky&#39;s the limit. It&#39;s much better than limiting them unnecessarily. You just can&#39;t forget the part about how they need to work to get there. ",1

14736,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Again, I disagree. I&#39;m no Piaget, but I believe a child&#39;s environment and upbringing are more important factors and markers for success than genetics. No one said kids are little geniuses (though, crucially, their capacity for learning things is known to outstrip that of adults), but instilling in them the values to aim high doesn&#39;t necessarily mean raising entitled brats - just the opposite, really. 

Not that being president requires any great genius, however much we like to pretend it does.",1
14737,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wwaaaaaaa,1
14738,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t think the sky is the limit for children. Genetics set the bar for everyone, children are not geniuses or models or have any modicum of artistic talent. That is the problem with parents these days, they raise these entitled children that grow up believing that they are awesome and expect that everything will go their way and when it doesn&#39;t then they throw a tantrum and start blaming other people.",1
14739,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I greatly admire this woman&#39;s vulnerability and honesty. It takes courage to admit to being insecure while feeling insecure. What a beautiful thing it is that she has done; put a tear in the sheet that covers the eyes of western civilization that encourages every one to achieve what is genetically out of reach.,1
14740,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Depends on who you&#39;re telling. 

If you&#39;re telling your construction worker friend whom you drink with on weekends that yeah! he should totally run for president, then that&#39;s probably imprudent. But people generally grow into being average, consequentially become aware of their limitations, and adjust their expectations accordingly. For kids, however, the sky&#39;s the limit (for the most part) and I see no reason to tell them otherwise.",1
14741,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Most people are average and could never be president. It&#39;s rather idiotic to tell people that they can be anything, they can&#39;t.",1
14742,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"took a lot of balls to take that talk, ironically",1
14743,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How can you say that when she said right in the talk 78% percent of black teenagers are insecure? ,1
14744,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,No need to feel guilty for privilege.  It happens. You can do positive things with it. And you can be president. It&#39;s OK.,1
14745,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,aw crap. you got me there! vicious circle i got myself stuck in!,1
14746,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the idea here isn&#39;t how likely she is to be voted president (obviously unlikely considering her lack of experience in politics), it&#39;s about appreciating the measure of oppression she experiences. it&#39;s similar to a garbage collector or a toilet cleaner (not a real job) in that they might be considered unintelligent, but for her she is experiencing oppression because of her gender and appearance. she&#39;s talking about bigotry, white privelege, and sexism. all of these are common and overlooked",1
14747,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yeah i&#39;m glad she spent a good amount of time talking about minorities and white privilege (although, i wish the talk could&#39;ve been longer). the reason i was concerned about her ability to switch careers into politics (as an example) it not because of the career itself, but the reason she would be restricted from entering that career. or, the reason people consider her unsuitable for that career.

i mean to say, why do beautiful white women seem so stupid and incompetent to so many people? ",1
14748,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s not as absurd as the idea of voting a person of any type into office.,1
14749,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She chose to be an underwear model. She didn&#39;t have to be one. If she wanted to be president, maybe she should have thought of that beforehand. Also, there are plenty of other jobs, which people have to do because they have no other choice (garbage collector, toilet cleaner, etc.) that limit their future mobility. They have REAL problems.

Bellyaching supermodels are not likely to get a positive reaction anywhere.",1
14750,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,BUT I&#39;M A VICTIM TOO BECAUSE I&#39;M A WOMAN.,1
14751,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why?,1
14752,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,BULL - SHIT,1
14753,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Never mind, plenty more fish in the sea, as they say! x
",1
14754,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was really good. I liked it.,1
14755,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Can there ever not be bias? As long as there is stratification someone will always be on top.,1
14756,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,or some jackass who comments just to point out that others comment on her appearance... so essentially you comment on her looks... :-D,1
14757,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"okay, so i did little more digging and i think she is still single :) yup i have a chance lol

on a serious note, she has a degree in economics and political science. She should understand that her approach of protest in this instance is not going to help much. Her argument is undeniable but implementable. Unless she starts her own modelling agency. In a perfect world we will have equel right for everyone but it is not the reality. ",1
14758,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"dammit, i thought i was going to be her first boyfriend. stupid me, always overestimate my limits. :)",1
14759,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"thanks. it&#39;s just that sometimes, reality sucks, you know?",1
14760,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What she said was that AT THAT TIME she had not had a boyfriend, not that she never has had one.",1
14761,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is about racism not fashion!,1
14762,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, that was honest. But I feel like there was something missing. What&#39;s the solution to overcome gender and racial oppression?",1
14763,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"brave, heart-felt, really good 
thank you",1
14764,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,smart lady.,1
14765,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"@pemphetru I think you both are taking it too seriously. I completely understand your frustration and contempt but if you are sincere in listening to the speaker&#39;s point and forgetting all else it shouldn&#39;t bother you. I think it&#39;s just that in this day in age, the first thing that comes to mind for many people when they see a woman like this center-stage the first thing that comes to mind is a quip about women&#39;s rights or dumb blondes. It will change, as all things do.",1
14766,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m pretty optimistic and believe that most people are capable of comprehending what these female speakers are discussing. But they don&#39;t want to accept the fact that these speakers are smart and intelligent because they are insecure themselves. They want to get attention from other commenters to make others chuckle and like their stupid comment. They feel uncomfortable talking about deep issues, things that really matter.",1
14767,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I was going back to the kitchen and then i heard her saying that she never had a boyfriend in her life; way to get my attention Cameron. ,1
14768,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Go for it!,1
14769,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Really tried to follow what she was trying to bring across. But I&#39;m sorry she&#39;s just too attractive. Need to watch this a second time.,1
14770,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,omg she&#39;s hot,1
14771,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,being narrowed down to how you look and upset about it is &quot;having my panties in a bunch&quot;? wow. what do you call having my ass grabbed by my boss?,1
14772,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well, that&#39;s because it would be ridiculous to vote a model into office.  To take an official position you need some degree of experience in whatever you&#39;ll be in charge of right?  If somebody had been both a model and something else related to running things, that might actually work in their favour.",1
14773,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,How can you say something is stupid when you didn&#39;t even watch it?,1
14774,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m so happy she talked about this. I and so many other women I know can relate. I&#39;ve had dozens of people tell me to go into modeling. I prefer the idea of going into politics... but apparently I should capitalize on my physical appearance, instead of helping the world as best I can.   ",1
14775,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"so we can listen to a talk that has interesting numbers and analysis about this subject, dan ariely is great at that = )",1
14776,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i&#39;m confused about the negative reactions. i&#39;m think it&#39;s awesome she was able to achieve this perspective considering her career and all that. 

i really liked when she mentioned that having &#39;underwear model&#39; or whatever limits your ability to branch out into other careers. there really is an unfair and oppressive prejudice toward models. it&#39;s somehow ridiculous to consider voting a model into office.",1
14777,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t think she won a genetic lottery. If someone has been skinny their whole life they can make their body look almost any way they want. The only thing you really can&#39;t control if you&#39;re a man is your face, and if you&#39;re a woman it&#39;s your face and boobs, which are genetic. Even bad skin can be cured with Solodyn.",1
14778,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,so... she&#39;s telling us that we don&#39;t think enough about how appearance impacts our lifes? How out of touch can you be? We think WAY TOO MUCH about it.,1
14779,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,why?,1

Now bring a &quot;cosmetically handicapped&quot; chick. I don&#39;t like the stupid word ugly, it make s people feel as if they are worthless, which they are absolutely not. The stupidity of humans of not treating other humans equal is proven in the comments below. I experience the feeling of being hideous when i got discoloration on my face and my grades went plummeting and not to recover. No one can change this BS. It&#39;s human nature.  ",1
14781,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Right on. ,1
14782,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You are right. I know what you&#39;re saying. ,1
14783,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It seemed to me like what she was saying was just to the delight of the audience. Her lesson, that I perceived as, was people don&#39;t choose how they look and how they want to be viewed as in the world. It doesn&#39;t seem hard to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when a person is a walking example of the halo effect. She also said she is insecure. My advice to anyone being insecure is just be who you are. Don&#39;t let other people change the way you live, because if that happens, you lose.",1
14784,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Don&#39;t get your panties in a bunch,1
14785,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i&#39;m thinking about getting a full-face tattoo of my own face,1
14786,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I would do her,1
14787,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I dont know why but I just did not really get her point. Maybe bcz the video was too short.

Well I would say she is beautiful and get some &#39;benefit&#39; from that . But she did not stress her point by saying what she has done to try to remove the halo from inside. ",1
14788,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this has one of the highest views as compared to recent videos on TED,1
14789,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Did you see the video?... That&#39;s exactly her point.,1
14790,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m a guy but as I heard this lecture, I was pretty sure most of the viewers were female but to my surprise, YouTube statistics say otherwise. Great lecture.",1
14791,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s easy for you to say. You&#39;re hot.,1
14792,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Whether you are told you are beautiful or not doesn&#39;t always mean that you have amazing self confidence. The prettiest girls can feel the ugliest things and I think that what you said was somewhat ignorant. It&#39;s not a matter of being a pretty insecure girl or an ugly one, but an insecure girl in society as a whole. This woman brings up many topics in her speech, and yet you chose not to listen to her words, but to judge them. Maybe you should take that into consideration ...",1
14793,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"all the nerdchicks were pissed 
when a dumb model infiltrated into their midst.
like when a spiny anteater 
invades a termite mound.
",1
14794,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yay! Smart models do exist XD 
I think the most interesting thing she did with this talk was the juxstaposition of her professional photographs and the real ones of just being herself.",1
14795,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Methinks you extrapolate too much.
Please point out exactly where I stated that I disagreed with her, or where I said that her points weren&#39;t substantive.
Maybe you should troll someone more worthy?",1
14796,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Seriously, is a model talking about how she is insecure about her looks? Lady, you may *think* you know what insecurity is, but you have no clue because you&#39;ve been told you are beautiful your whole life and you&#39;ve been given things because of your beauty. Try and be ugly, overweight, unpopular, teased, broken, and depressed. That is insecurity. That&#39;s a DAILY struggle, literally. Daily reminders you are good enough or pretty enough. What&#39;s next on TED? Bill Gates complaining about being broke?",1
14797,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"ted, get an ugly person to give a very similar talk and compare the views and the comments, how many of them where about the looks, how many about the content of the talk and how many about both... also you could use demographic info too and then get Dan Ariely to give a talk on the results = )",1
14798,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think she had some pretty great points if you know what I&#39;m saying,1
14799,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s not very scientific, but she&#39;s very brave, clever and well researched. ",1
14800,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There is a third option. Actually listening, evaluating what she said and considering it is somewhat of a missed opportunity.
I do think there are good points in the talk. But it suffers from its structure, a set of seemingly random questions. As a result of it all, it is not entirely exact message she tries to convey, leaving us, in part, in the dark. It&#39;s more up to the listener to extract the message, which is tricky.",1
14801,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There is an uncomfortable tension on youtube. If i have to read one more comment on her appearance that completely disregards her speech and her point... and it&#39;s the same for every video with a female speaker. Never &quot;good point&quot; or  &quot;she knows what she&#39;s talking about&quot;. No, it&#39;s that jackass caveman who wants to hit her that gets attention. ",1
14802,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i disagree, i don&#39;t think it&#39;s brave to speak about this. Most people would agree that modeling is superficial and quite logically one would understand that models are insecure. She&#39;s trying to empower others but this is not brave. I DO however appreciate her intelligent speech",1
14803,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,seriously? so most human beings are white and have the ability to get a university education?,1
14804,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sure, some did comment on her looks. Others did comment/criticize. In a away it proofs the point.

The ones which are &#39;far&#39; off from the &#39;perfect&#39; image have to proof more (the black and latino example). The ones that fit okay have to overcome less, and the perfect look is expected to just be pretty (the president example).

Listening and commenting on the quality of her talk is &#39;the correct answer&#39;, you &#39;ignore&#39; her looks. I think it&#39;s a known yet still important message, but poorly conveyed.",1
14805,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,marry me!! ;D,1
14806,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Sorry! I&#39;m afraid the joke was lost on me. O_o,1
14807,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,it&#39;s kind of like exploiting yourself in a way... then you justify the bad parts by thinking about what a nice opportunity it is and how it will help you pay for college.,1
14808,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I treat her the way i would like to be treated. I&#39;m assuming a lot of things as well, and yes I&#39;m colored by beauty. But I&#39;d rather give someone the benefit of the doubt by what they say than make a snap judgment based on something they did not have control over. She says imagr is a part of our society, but It is not everything. I choose to interpret that as She makes her living on her image, but it is not her life. And I take joy in someone&#39;s success and honesty. ",1
14809,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"and of course, these are just assumptions themselves, based on my impression of her. but i&#39;d rather assume the best in someone i dont know from what little glimpse of personality I have than assume something that&#39;ll lessen both of us.
",1
14810,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the problem with that line of thinking is that you&#39;re assuming that because their lives are charmed, they don&#39;t come with hardships or opportunities for growth. I&#39;ve known some people that are lucky and make the best of their blessings because they recognize them and others that bemoan their lots in life when in reality they haven&#39;t recognized what the Do have and live lives which are strings of missed opportunities. yes she is lucky. and she knows it. and she doesnt seem to take it for granted.",1
14811,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She has bills to pay,a life of luxury and a method to make the most money possible like most human beings.
",1
14812,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,agree!  This is an incredibly brave speech to deliver.,1
14813,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She understands what its like to be judged based on looks, because she wins that competition whenever she wants.  The point is she doesn&#39;t know what its like to lose.  How can I respect someone when they&#39;re given most of what they have in life because they won the genetic lottery?  I&#39;m honestly asking.  To me its exactly the same as trying to respect Bill Gates&#39; son.  Its hard.",1
14814,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You hit it right on the nose, Angela.  Thank you!",1
14815,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Haha, didn&#39;t expect that reply. That&#39;s cool, have a good life.",1
14816,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That was amazing! I love her! These days, it takes courage to actually SAY and acknowledge what&#39;s demonstrably true.",1
14817,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Ok don&#39;t read between the lines then.  ,1
14818,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Exactly she has no idea what&#39;s she talking about and hasn&#39;t even tried to put herself in someone else&#39;s shoes.  To me it sounds like she didn&#39;t actually like modelling but just went along with it because it was easier and still today she&#39;s in the biz.  Try watching a rich person tell a homeless person money isn&#39;t everything, just watch the reaction.",1
14819,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t want her to do anything, that&#39;s up to her but if she wants to stand in front of intelligent people and talk about how her looks aren&#39;t everything then please by all means prove it.  Show us why looks aren&#39;t everything because a change of clothes doesn&#39;t change who you are.  Lol I wasn&#39;t really advocating taking drugs, but definitely a change of lifestyle.  Even you are not treating her equally, thinking she&#39;s a tame flower that needs to be protected.  Actions speak louder than words imo.",1
14820,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Pulled those words right out of my mouth. Thank you !,1
14821,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Do you think they all &quot;starve&quot;? Sure some do... But what about those that simply eat a healthy diet consisting of 70%+ fruits and vegetables and exercise regularly... It&#39;s not starving yourself in every case... pull your head out!,1
14822,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What? you want this woman to debase her self worth to prove something to you? she&#39;s speaking from experience which is all we can ever talk about, and what&#39;s more she&#39;s being honest and vulnerable in front of millions of people. Take it how you will, but to me that is courage. Yeah she&#39;s beautiful, she&#39;s led a charmed life, but she knows it and that puts her far ahead of the curve.",1
14823,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yeah you&#39;re right but you have to appreciate her for recognizing this even if she&#39;s never experienced it first-hand. I mean even you know more people will likely listen to her so if she speaks out it&#39;s not that bad of a thing.,1
14824,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s incredibly attractive either way.  I find it hard to respect people this beautiful because they don&#39;t have a clue what its like to be ugly.  They think they do, because they may have a poor self image, but they don&#39;t.  When you&#39;re actually unattractive you get treated much differently than when you think you&#39;re unattractive, but have been a model for ten years.  Life is easier when you&#39;re pretty.  Like Tosh says, &quot;being an ugly woman is like being a man, you&#39;re going to have to work.&quot;",1
14825,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Nope, you&#39;re still hot.  It didn&#39;t work.  Why you think most designers dress their models in bin bags?  She&#39;s a hipster model.  I hate being stereotyped as being beautiful but still enjoy all the benefits conferred by genetics.  If she really wanted to change how people looked at her, she should start doing meth for a few months, lose her job, and try to get employed not on the basis of her looks.  Talk, as they say, is cheap.",1
14826,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,For me it would be redeemable if she did this speach and wouldnt be still in the business.,1
14827,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If looks isnt everything why do all models fucking starv to be what they call &quot;beutiful&quot;??
",1
14828,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Her conclusion: I hope we feel more comfortable with the power of image in our perceived successes and failures ... Is she trying to say looks mean something, or we shouldn&#39;t care about looks? - A bit confused.",1
14829,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she is a model because men of power find her attractive. if the men of power were of a different color or ethnicity then she would not have won the lottery, because standards of beauty are different amongst different people. if you look at a wreck video you will not find many women that look like Cameron Russell. these women will be thick in the thighs and have a lot of butt and breastsbecause that is what the rappers like and they are in power to choose the women who are to be in there videos.",1
14830,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This was an interesting Talk but it was somewhat whiny and a bit hypocritical.  &quot;These are things that are so bad about modeling.  But...I am not going to quit doing it because the perks are great..but wow is it a rough way to make a living so don&#39;t do it.&quot;  So why do it?  

Also, she some degree of guilt for being born with her figure.  Professional athletes are born with athletic ability.  Some people are born with great intellect.  It is about leveraging your assets.  What is wrong with that?",1

14833,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good talk but wish it was longer,1
14834,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Better pay, more likely to get a job (though sometimes employers need to hire non-white people to avoid the assumption of being racists), more likely to have been born in a successful family, more likely to be born in a safe environment, less likely to be put in jail, more likely to be stopped by police... the list goes on. Isn&#39;t it worse to be an aborigine among aussies and kiwis?",1

Besides, saying beautiful people can&#39;t be insecure is just silly. They&#39;re human just like everybody else. Beauty isn&#39;t the be all and end all, it&#39;s a mixture of many things about a person that makes them happy. :)  ",1

14852,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If I had to guess, I&#39;d say the topic was somewhere along the lines of dispelling the power of image we hold in our heads.
Around 5:30 she starts revealing the image that others create, and what she actually looks like. Because she knows that when women (and men) see her in magazines and photos, people think that&#39;s her, when it&#39;s actually an image that fashion designers, make-up artists, photographers, and editors have manufactured.
And that people chase after this superficial, fabricated image.",1

14858,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Many industries have this misogynist/racist thing going on and people like her usually stay in it BUT have the guts to talk about it because they want their industry to change. Advocacy usually starts from speaking out publicly.,1

14866,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"One should always try to find out the true nature of things. 
One may pretend to be simple though one may not be. The saffron colored dress stands for renunciation and selflessness. The person wearing it is considered to be a saint.

",1
14869,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I really liked her talk, but the modeling industry is still fairly representative of the majority culture in the West.  Europe is more White, but America is still 70%+ White.

When she says only 2 models were non-white, when you include Europe and the US that&#39;s about the right ratio for representation.  Just American, it would have to be like 4-6 of 30.  As society changes more, the ratio of non-White to White models will increase, trust me.  Of course there will be delay, but it will increase.",1
14870,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Well... Maybe she still works in the industry because she makes tons of money which allows her to help others in a way that she wouldn&#39;t be able to if she wasn&#39;t a model? I don&#39;t know for sure but maybe? I do know that you don&#39;t get invited to do a TED talk if your a self serving douche bag.,1
14871,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I was expecting to really hate this, but I didn&#39;t.",1
14872,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Such a keen sense of perception. You must be pretty chuffed with yourself. ,1
14873,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is vastly intelligent and to me that made her far more beautiful and attractive than any professional photo.,1
14874,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t know about you, but I understand it as a courage.
",1
14875,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"thank you.
",1
14876,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m really glad she&#39;s discovered that there is more to life other than being really really really really ridiculously good looking and is now focusing on helping people. What people?, you ask? I don&#39;t know, maybe the people who need help. Now if this didn&#39;t cheer you up, I suggest an ORANGE MOCHA FRAPPECHINO! ",1
14877,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So, she realises that the industry she works in is part of the problem why teenage girls hate their bodies and have low selfesteem, and she still works in the industry, why? That would be my question.",1
14878,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is absolutely amazing! Probably my favourite TED talk of all time. ,1
14879,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you for talking about stop and frisk,1
14880,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But...the real question is &quot;can u be my wife?&quot;,1
14881,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Same here! 
",1
14882,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A real example of the power of image: Susan Boyle&#39;s first singing audition.,1
14883,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"seems like a very genuine and intelligent girl, i like her.",1
14884,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Oh he makes sure everyone knows the extent of his generosity.He has Ted Talks and the sheer weight of how much he gives merely reflects the sheer weight of how much he has.Do we know what actual percentage of his wealth he invests in good causes? Do we know the actual extent of his wealth?. Finally he&#39;s a business man,a very successful and very ruthless business man.That bottom is hard wired into his world view.
He doesn&#39;t have to do it. Why he does it,no one can be 100% sure.So WE speculate.",1
14885,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Excellent and so honest. I&#39;m going to post this to my Facebook page :-),1
14886,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,80 percent women didn&#39;t clap at the end.,1
14887,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Hi chill yar, there are good people also, and thanks for sharing your story",1
14888,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"As an exceptionally handsome brown man with no real shot in the modeling industry, I accept this bitter truth. hehe",1
14889,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The thing is, he does very little to actually advertise this, and the sheer weight of how much he gives to charity i think destroys any possible speculation that he&#39;s chasing a bottom line.",1
14890,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this talk would&#39;ve been more compelling if she discussed how magazines attempted to make her look more &quot;white&quot; than mixed latino, which she appears to be. ",1
14891,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People.. give her a break.. she gave an honest talk about what life is like for a model..a model most girls would die to be like.. and showed them that there is so much more to life and she has the same insecurities as everyone else. Awesome, honest talk...",1
14892,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree with the fact that being white opens many doors to everything ... Just look the beauty gurus here on YouTube , all the most successful are white girls..or light coloured skin ...I am glad she is using her power to talk about these issues",1
14893,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Cameron, thanks for that. You were bit nervous, but that made the honesty even more sincere :) . Best of luck in your future endeavors and advocacy. You seem like a cool person to have a coffee with someday...",1
14894,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Of course I don&#39;t know that for a fact: Without access to a time machine, I can&#39;t know that absolutely - and maybe not even then.  What I can know is that I have ~20 years behind the wheel, and I&#39;ve been pulled over more than once.  I also know I&#39;ve treated all of them with manners and respect.  I&#39;ve had *one* ticket downgraded.  Not &quot;let off with a warning&quot;, but &quot;treated less grievously&quot;.

BTW: You probably didn&#39;t mean it, but that phrasing sounds like you assume I&#39;m normally offensive to them.",1
14895,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She really doesn&#39;t have to say or do anything...,1
14896,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this was basically a story with no lesson. she also generalized every model. im sure some models dont feel insecure, and some models are happy with their lives. just because she isn&#39;t doesnt give her the right to speak for everyone. also, although she was telling her personal experience, there was nothing to get out from her recounting. terrible TED talk",1
14897,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This talk was so honest and genuine. I&#39;ll remember this for a long time.,1
14898,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,yes all people who aren&#39;t as pretty as this woman are going to find themselves instinctively irritated by the things she is saying. but why? just because she&#39;s being honest? isnt it even more irritating when a beautiful girl says how ugly she is all the time? i think she&#39;s being exceptionally brave by talking in this way. ,1
14899,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Saying &quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a model&quot; is like saying, &quot;Race isn&#39;t everything. Believe me, I&#39;m a rich white guy.&quot;",1
14900,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is hot,1
14901,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Very nice, I&#39;d say outstanding girl, and very nice talk. But, still not persuasive againts enormours pressure of advertising, media icons, TV, shows, etc on what a woman should look like. That&#39;s why these little girls want to be models, not scientists, doctors, entrepreneurs.  With all my superior education, high abilities in Math, superb profession and achievements, great opportunities ahead - I cant lie to myself that I&#39;d sacrifise at least a part of that - to have her look!!!",1
14902,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So basically, there&#39;s more to life than being really, really good looking?",1
14903,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I listened to this 10min talk but I did not take away any benefits !!! :\  I wont say i wasted my time because I knew there are useless talks.  sorry to anyone who liked the lecture ,1
14904,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Do you know that for a fact? Why don&#39;t you try it out: The next time you get pulled over for a minor infraction, try being respectful and polite. She&#39;s right that image impacts how people are treated, but I am hesitant to believe it is based more on looks than on behavior.",1
14905,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yeah, thanks, I&#39;ve already figured that out watching other Talks. I just imagine somebody who doesn&#39;t speak well trying to use them... Most of TED talks have high quality verified multilingual subs on their site, so it&#39;s kinda weird to see these here..",1
14906,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah, I know. I am not criticizing. I just see quite often people have great ideas but they are too shy and delicate and insecure to &quot;make&quot; somebody understand. She had a courage to speak up, I just think she might have even more success doing it louder so to speak.",1
14907,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She isn&#39;t complaining.  She&#39;s saying it&#39;s unfair.  If anything it&#39;s even MORE credible coming from her.,1
14908,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think you didn&#39;t understand her when she said it was hard for her to talk about the injustice of looks-based discrimination when she was a huge beneficiary of them.,1
14909,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She SAID she was insecure!,1
14910,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I switched on a subtitle for a moment and the text there is just nothing like what she&#39;s saying. What a lousy job - did anybody check this at all?

Great talk by the way. Actually she could have been much more compelling if she was a bit more secure and assertive. There were some great ideas, but the presentation is a bit on a shy side.",1
14911,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wow...she appears to be both beautiful inside and out.  Great heart-warming presentation.,1
14912,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Loved this!,1
14913,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"she said she has a fake tan earlier in the talk, she&#39;s definitely white look at the pictures where she isn&#39;t a model.",1
14914,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Did I miss something? She looks Latino to me, not white. Also, I got the impression someone wrote this talk for her. ",1
14915,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why is this only 9 minutes long? 

Would have loved to her continuing her argument in more detail. ",1
14916,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Modelling is a bullshit industry. She didn&#39;t say anything that isn&#39;t already common knowledge but good on her anyway.Only women can stop the media war on women so the fewer women who buy into the bullshit the better for them and for humanity.,1
14917,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,On the surface it looks that way but I suspect he&#39;s really ensuring Microsoft gain a strong positive image that will boost future sales in developing countries.,1
14918,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That is what I thought until I found some comments that showed that it had worked for some.,1
14919,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The importance of this talk is, that is counters all the &quot;documentaries&quot; that glorify and glamorize models and the business around them.
It is nice to hear about the social benefits of being a great looking white woman from one. Usually the gifted people do not admit it. You hear the ugly and poor complaining, but not the ones who inherited, admitting that they have it easy, too often it is the other way around.",1
14920,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i don&#39;t think she&#39;s trying to teach &quot;don&#39;t judge by looks&quot; even though, yes, that is one of the messages. i think she&#39;s trying to get people to check their privilege. i feel like it&#39;s really easy for successful white people to attribute everything they have to their own hard work, and completely disregard the underlying racial undertones that might have helped them along the way. i think she is at once acknowledging the ways this &#39;lottery&#39; has both greatly benefited her and harmed her in a way.",1
14921,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She is brave to be honest but how does this change anything? Life is unfair... So.,1
14922,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"must great to be white, female and hawt.  HIGHEST ladder on the social totem pole.
Down at the bottom are Asian men and black women.  
",1
14923,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"hi! im a man, a 30 yo man, and i think i have a pretty messed up idea of the ideal girl for me, and u really helped me rethink a lot of things. thx!",1
14924,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I love it that TED talks are now becoming almost COMPLETELY INDISTINGUISHABLE from The Onion videos that mock them!,1
14925,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,It&#39;s funny because Bill Gates is an incredible philanthropist. :),1
14926,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yeah, now it is okay for me, too.  Maybe the uploader fixed it (?).  I dunno, but you can gather from the 26 &quot;likes&quot; that my first comment got that others got ear-raped just like I did when they watched it before.",1
14927,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Her speech belongs in a Classroom full of 8th grade girls. not at TED. We are all grown folks here. This is old news..i wonder who le..Damn she&#39;s fine! lol.,1
14928,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"True, actually so very true, Looks aren&#39;t everything. But no looks often means nothing.",1
14929,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The title is irony. &quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything believe me I am a model.&quot; Everybody will say it bullshit, because she is beautiful. That is what she&#39;s talking about. Look is nothing yet it is also everything. She is a smart girl, too bad she beautiful and opposite also true.",1
14930,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good talk, but nothing new to be perfectly honest. You have to be pretty dazed to think that models aren&#39;t affected negatively by the pressures that the industry impose on them. ",1
14931,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This may sound like a sexist thing, but I started to pay attention but losing interest after she changed her outfit.",1
14932,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Though also, her points about insecurity from being a model are well-put. Of course when your career and feedback every day rest on your looks and appearances, you&#39;ll become critical of your looks and appearances. I think that&#39;s part of why this idea of &quot;putting your strengths to work&quot; for external gratification (money, attention, etc) is shaky. 

We&#39;re all human beings. Work hard at what you want to work at. Look for positive results not attention, and you&#39;ll be far happier.",1
14933,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Except that by growing up looking good you&#39;re implicitly used to people being more open and tolerable of EVERYTHING you do because they&#39;re more attracted to and accepting of you - particularly for women. While this has it&#39;s downsides (easier to develop a narcissistic or histrionic complex) it also confers certain benefits like increased confidence and a belief that no matter what you do people will accept you for who you are, unlike ugly people who have to fight tooth and nail to be accepted.",1
14934,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,haha... It takes one to know one I guess. ,1
14935,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Dumb.,1
14936,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"what a wonderful piece.
",1
14937,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Money isn&#39;t everything...I have been nearly homeless before and now I have several million in real assets.  The main difference is you have to be more careful about your &quot;friends&quot; because not everyone who acts like your friend is your friend.  Besides its easy to make money once you set your mind to achieving small goals every day and pursuing something you really enjoy, are good at, and that fulfills a demand in the market.",1
14938,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Beautiful people will always have a better life, they&#39;re treated better and they&#39;re given promotions and raises more easily. But as bill gates says, &quot;life isn&#39;t fair&quot;.  So if you hate your situation then there&#39;s no one else to blame but yourself.",1
14939,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Also, I felt she was saying that having so much attention centered on her looks, especially from such a young age, has caused a lot of insecurities about it, since her job is entirely based on the way she looks. It&#39;s human nature, and being in that kind of environment for any period of time can leave physiological effects on anyone, in this case, insecurity about her body and probably about who she is as a person too.",1
14940,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y," She&#39;s stating facts of her industry. That is what I felt her talk was trying to convey, that there are many things about it that are so selective of things that are out of peoples control, so it&#39;s better to look at your strengths in academics, skills, etc, because they are more attainable, instead of pining away at an image that professionals portray, because even she, the model, isn&#39;t enough to portray that on her own. It&#39;s unrealistic.",1
14941,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"well we all hardwired to think what&#39;s pretty is nice what&#39;s ugly is bad,  we seen that in everyday cartoons",1
14942,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That made me cry,1
14943,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Beautiful HONEST talk. I know enough models to know this is true. :),1
14944,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i am very impressed ,1
14945,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Image tells you the story but not the truth. You need to interpret the story through a set of languages. Like the body language. But most of the other stuff can be faked. I can&#39;t spot a fake LV bag from 10 feet and I can&#39;t spot a person that spent 1 year worth of salary for an original LV bag. Clothing and make-up tell a story but in a language that was lost. Hopefully people will not take up acting lessons and become Oscar winning actors.,1
14946,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Two objects are attracted to fall towards each other by the shortest possible route&quot;

How very deep....but this statement actually got men to stand on the moon.",1
14947,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It&#39;s a little disturbing how even TED talks tend to chronically keep underrepresenting minority/colored women. Basic progressive policy is to prioritize the underprivileged. Yet, the very women in society who suffer the most from the pressures of the religious right and who lack social mobility most often are, time and again, being sidelined in favor of upper class Western white females.

We&#39;re in the year 2013. Something about this mentality is really worrying.",1
14948,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i have a feeling the only reason this got the amount of likes it did is because of image.,1
14949,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is pretty, its so good she revealed it. Especially because she is still young ! If a model is old you can easily say: what stupid to say this when you are retired.",1
14950,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;I just completely changed what you thought of me in 6 seconds.&quot;

No you didn&#39;t honey.",1
14951,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I watched this with the sound turned off,1
14952,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Smart honest talk from a model... Did that just happen?,1
14953,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,no she&#39;s extremely pretty.,1
14954,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,is your avatar ironic ? o~o,1
14955,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Sure, but if I&#39;d tried the same thing with the same cop, I&#39;d have got a ticket where she skated.  Why?  Because she&#39;s a honey, and I&#39;m large, hairy guy.",1
14956,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, people still need to hear this.  They need to hear it now more than ever.  Those stats she quoted about kids not liking their bodies aren&#39;t made up, and those alone should tell you that.",1
14957,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,shes not very pretty...,1
14958,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She makes great points, but its very hypocritical to earn your money for 10 years by being a model and then act like looks aren&#39;t everything.

If she realizes the harmful effects that stereotypes cause, why would she be spreading them by gracing magazine covers.    

I understand that she started modeling young (like most), but if  she really believes in waht she&#39;s saying she would quit being a model, and counsel anorexic and bulimic teens...",1
14959,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m a pretty white woman. No, I take that back I&#39;m actually a sexy girl.",1
14960,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wtf i was listening to?
",1
14961,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Do people seriously still need to hear stuff like this? &#39;looks aren&#39;t everything&#39; ...no shit?,1
14962,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s right, attractive people tend to earn more money, get promoted more &amp; less jail time. Do the research. Looks often rule our society.

Her talk may have helped people who don&#39;t realize that magazine&#39;s images are often fantasy.",1
14963,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"$10 says if she had been a bitch to that cop, he would have written her a ticket.",1
14964,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The whole point of this talk was to explain how no ones perfect and better yet no one needs to be perfect. It&#39;s also a ted talk about how everyone feels insecure, even some of the most beautiful women in the world. And a lot of you won&#39;t be able to look past the superficial and see what she&#39;s really talking about... it&#39;s a pity. ",1
14965,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this is horrible, there&#39;s nothing new or interesting here.",1
14966,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It picked her? In what fucking way? How does a job pick you without you being able to control signing a contract? Does a pen just jump out of your pocket and magically sign your name in black and white? So in other words all that matters is the intention, not the actual effort or sacrifice that was taken? No wonder you people gave obama the peace prize.",1
14967,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Coming up next, Bill Gates talks about how money isn&#39;t everything.",1
14968,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Fat chicks are sexy...inside.....way beneath all those thick layers of fat.&quot; not true. But if this pretend world is true there would be more shortage of food and people would roll around and do nothing all day.,1
14969,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I forgot to mention when one applies for PhD usually you get scholarship with doing it. As PhD thesis and studies is supposed to help the society in someways.,1
14970,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Actually once you graduated with a degree you can choose any where in the world to get a PhD as long as the university that you choose has the facilities and you pass the simple requirements. PhD is just hard work. If you can graduate with a degree and want a PhD its not so hard. Its all about dedication and the will to work! If your thesis fails then you just configure your thesis to complement the results. Its a bummer to live in a world where results is everything.,1
14971,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Sup mangina.,1
14972,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"if think you should change your example because you&#39;re pointing out that the ones who are being discriminated are the ones who should chance, and the example of this model is exactly the opposite: People of lighter skin color like this model, have more privilege then people of darker skin color. the poeple of darker skin are the &quot;gays&quot; of your example, and they are not the ones who need to change, but the privileged lighter skin models like this model.
&quot;What would be her involvment&quot; i wrote &quot;IF&quot;",1
14973,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Mangina!,1
14974,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"once again, comparing the complaints of the redesign of a website layout to the discrimination of an entire industry is simplistic and futile.
besides, those &#39;people which are complaining&#39; about the layout, are not the same people making profit with the ugliness of the website, the same way this model is making profit with the injustice of this industry.
if people supported a fascist then they should be accounted for it. 
btw, &#39;the entire country&#39; didn&#39;t vote for Mubarack.",1
14975,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So let&#39;s change the example to you live in one state of america (= the system) where you aren&#39;t allowed to marry (= the policy). The gays living in one state agree with the policy because they can move to another state where they are allowed to marry? 
It doesn&#39;t matter that some move, we are talking about the ones that don&#39;t move. 
What would be her involvment in something criminal? ",1
14976,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;So if the system is complex, the rules no longer apply?&quot; no, the example you gave doesn&#39;t apply, while gays can not marry on some states they Can however marry on other.
&quot;..your point was, the rules no longer apply?&quot; that&#39;s a strawman argument.
&quot;then by your argument they are agreeing with the policy because they don&#39;t move to another state.&quot; actually, the large majority do move to those specific states.
&quot;(unless you were involved in something criminal anyway)&quot; that&#39;s the point.",1
14977,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So if the system is complex, the rules no longer apply? Or is it: If I find an argument that shows how ridiculous your point was, the rules no longer apply? 
Btw if they can marry in certain States, then by your argument they are agreeing with the policy because they don&#39;t move to another state. 
I&#39;m sorry but if you can prove that you didn&#39;t have a choice in a crime (unless you were involved in something criminal anyway) you are innocent. ",1
14978,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;by living in America you are part of the system&quot; i think that&#39;s not a good example because the &quot;american system&quot; is complex and relative i.e: homosexuals Can marry on certain States.
&quot;If you can&#39;t change it (even if you agree) you are not responsible&quot; the thing is, she Did Not want to change it while being a model, in fact, she took profit of it, therefore, being also responsible.
i.e: if this was a crime she would be an complicit.  ",1
14979,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I didn&#39;t say you were a hypocrite, I said she wasn&#39;t one. 
Being part of the system does no equal being part of the policy, by living in America you are part of the system. America has certain policies like: &quot;gays cant marry&quot;. Do you think the gays in America are part of that policy because they are part of the system? 
If you can&#39;t change it (even if you agree) you are not responsible. If you can&#39;t quit and you disagree and fight but still work in the company, you are not responsible. ",1
14980,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i suppose we&#39;ve seen a different video then.,1
14981,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What point did she make? That people judge a book by its cover? How deep. How original. How worthy to be on TED.,1
14982,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Very agressive&quot; you&#39;re the one insinuating that i was being hypocrite on your first reply.
&quot;Very naive&quot; the irony is really thick on this one
&quot;she isn&#39;t part of the policy because she does not hire herself.&quot; she doesn&#39;t need to hire herself to be part of the system.
&quot;Not everyone can just quit when they don&#39;t agree with something&quot; but being part of it still makes them responsible 
",1
14983,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;your argument makes no sense&quot; that&#39;s because thast&#39;s not my argument but a strawman you made up. 
Furthermore comparing the aestetics/layout of a website to the discrimination/unjustice of an industry is not reasonable.",1
14984,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, yet its a point most people MISS. Even in everyday life. Therefore saying something that is &quot;obvious&quot; yet most people miss is KINDA IMPORTANT.",1
14985,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A very well-articulated, honest, and balanced talk.

To the critics: You can keep eating your sour grapes, or learn to accept yourselves and stop hating on those who appear to be more &quot;privileged&#39; than you.  Her point was that genetically-privileged people are still human, and that she can&#39;t control how people REACT to her.  She seems pretty well-adjusted, but plenty of gorgeous people aren&#39;t...they&#39;re not immune to dysfunction in their lives, and they feel it the same way.",1

2) Very naive

You do not have to keep repeating yourself. You have made yourself clear, I understand, I just disagree. Capatalizing doesn&#39;t make me magicly agree. 

She obviously disagrees and she isn&#39;t part of the policy because she does not hire herself. 
Not everyone can just quit when they don&#39;t agree with something, not everyone has that power or enough money of mommy and daddy to turn back to. 

How old are you? ",1
14987,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s not talking about guilt.  She&#39;s speaking on the shallowness of the industry in which she works that a lot of &quot;6 year old girls&quot; don&#39;t realize exists.  You are seeing this a s an attractive woman grasping for attention, which isn&#39;t the point. You need to pull your head out of your ass and see this video for what it is: A woman that works in an image-based profession speaking on the unfortunate importance placed on image in day-to-day life.  She&#39;s not a genius, but she is intelligent.",1
14988,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What makes you say that?,1
14989,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree, this is not TED material per se. Consider also how young she is. That&#39;s what a retired 45 year old run down model would reveal in a book or on Oprah because her shiny paint has run dry. This is a gutsy lady nevertheless, she natively has much more substance &amp; depth than of what people see. ",1
14990,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, and money is not everything either. At least, Warren Buffet tells that.",1
14991,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"lot of people are talking as if they actually know how it is to be a model. you are missing the point completely. It&#39;s exactly what she is saying. we have have these preconceived thoughts about what beauty is, We also have these preconceived ideas of how it is if we were more beautiful or how it is to be a model. You have no idea how hard and how dull it can be. I agree there wasn&#39;t one point but it gave a more realistic view of modeling.",1
14992,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am so sorry to say this, but I am so sure that she is honest.",1
14993,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"thank you for your honesty and courage!!  &lt;3
",1
14994,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yes, and yet she says she had never had a real boyfriend :) LOL. total tragedy then. ",1
14995,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I liked nothing but the &quot;the genetic lottery&quot; concept.,1
14996,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She&#39;s missing a crucial point here: luck is mandatory, for everyone. People don&#39;t realize how much it affects their lives, thinking they are in control. If you have a PhD from MIT it means you were smart enough to achieve it and had enough money to afford it - &quot;enough&quot; can mean having somewhere to stay. Hence, theoretically, both models and MIT PhDs won a lottery.",1
14997,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Sounds like she had her boyfriend write the speech for her.,1
14998,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,And that&#39;s how white felt  abot the   business of slaves....,1
14999,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But she makes no major point whatsoever. A 6 years old girl could have said that. It&#39;s funny how a model &quot;speaking smart&quot; is seen as a genius lol. &quot;Look how shallow people are, I change clothes and they think i&#39;ve changed&quot; I would say look how shallow she is, she bases her whole life on modelling and getting money from posing looks. Not &quot;doing&quot; anything. Looks to me like a guilt issue that doesn&#39;t concern me at all. TED is not a self-therapy scene.",1
15000,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Already know - mentally.

Knowing is more than just cognitive. She brings feeling, or inspiration if you will, into the understanding due to her having direct experience, as well as her candidness.",1
15001,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow how many times do i have to repeat myself. if she IS PART of the policy, and she is TAKING PROFIT of it, then not only she AGREES with the policy, she&#39;s also working for it to happen.
it doesn&#39;t matter if it is a job, or your school, if you are part of the &quot;system&quot; then you are guilty as well. If you don&#39;t quit the system is because you are taking advantage of the system as well. This kind of systems wouldn&#39;t exist if it wasn&#39;t for people like you and this model.
",1
15002,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the point about modeling being rather not about her (who she is), but actually that fashion is about a collaborative construction made by creative people other than herself - is a good one too ;)",1
15003,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Finally, a thoughtful comment. Well done. I agree.",1
15004,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If I did not make the policy, then I am not a hypocrite. She did not make that policy. 
I wouldn&#39;t blame myself if bosses would enforce a policy I don&#39;t agree with and I wouldn&#39;t quit my job over it.  
I complain about my school all the time, I recommend people to go to another one. I&#39;m still at that school because I would not receive my degree otherwise. No, that would not make me a hypocrite. I&#39;m trying to stop people to make the same mistake before its too late.",1
15005,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She exploited the system....she didn&#39;t deny she did.  She has a look people were willing to pay her for.  She said she didn&#39;t set out to be a model, it picked her.  She isn&#39;t the whole problem, it is the whole industry that is the problem.  Also if the crack addict won the lotto, then went to school and invested his money in working with other crack addicts to get them off crack.. I would call him accomplished!  ",1
15006,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"so.. saying &quot;the system is unfair!&quot; ..and then taking advantage of the system for her own profit, is not being hypocrite, sure.
&quot;I can disagree with a policy and still work&quot; ok, but don&#39;t blame others if you&#39;re -Part of the policy-, you should blame yourself as well, either way you would be an hypocrite.. that&#39;s the point.",1
15007,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"People go into business for the same reasons, money, power, luxury. So what you don&#39;t have any time, and might even loose your health in pursuit of wealth. I feel insecure as well and im not on a front cover, and if Im a rich entrepreneur one day, Ill stand up on a stage and tell people how bad the business is etc. ",1
15008,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"...and her breast, long legs, and stunning face, I agree completely!",1
15009,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That isn&#39;t hypocritical, hypocritical is saying you disapprove but still working to keep that system in place. Hypocritical is saying that make-up kills animals and wearing it yourself.
She makes some statements about the world she operates in. I don&#39;t need to approve of everything about my workplace to be able to work there and love working there. 
I can disagree with a policy and still work, people need money. Me starving wont change anything.",1

15012,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,agree,1
15013,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I just don&#39;t think TED is the place to show up and state the obvious. I think it takes guts to come out and say something controversial, not saying something everyone agrees on already.",1
15014,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"but to assume that the audience would change their view of her just be changing her clothes so subtly just shows she&#39;s projecting her own views onto them. I didn&#39;t think any differently of her before or after, and I doubt anyone else did either. Unless it&#39;s a drastic change from a thong into a business suit, there&#39;s really no reason to make a judgement yet. But she seems to think there is one.",1
15015,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"agreed. I felt like it negated every obvious thing she was saying. looks shouldn&#39;t matter blah blah blah, but even as a model, I still don&#39;t think I&#39;m pretty enough.",1
15016,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"how is she not shallow? she thinks that everyone changes their perception of her based just on her clothes? she&#39;s still insecure about her looks, even being a model? how much more fixated on looking pretty can you get?",1

15018,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Clothed Cognition or Embodied Cognition? I&#39;ve read something from a Stanford philosophy paper but I cant help feeling skeptic.,1
15019,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m not sure what the point but she hit the nail on the head about image (and voice) being poweful tools..,1
15020,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Am I the only one who didn&#39;t feel a scrap of sympathy or surprise when she said she was insecure? You are completely out of control of your own destiny, you have no transferable skills, you won&#39;t stay young forever, modelling is notorious for throwing people out the second they hit an unmarketable age, your entire career and thus your financial security is based entirely on the way you look. And you&#39;re insecure about your body? I am too, only I have to worry about employable skills as well.",1
15021,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Changing everyone&#39;s perception of her by changing her clothes. How shallow are the audience that they could be swayed so easily.&quot; is the point she&#39;s making. Not, &quot;Look, I&#39;m a different person now!&quot; like some strange version of Super Mario Brothers 64 where the hat you wear defines the character you play as.",1
15022,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Correct: Looks aren&#39;t everything if you are already a model,1
15023,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"still kind of hard to take the pretty girls that come out and say one way or the other, beauty is not everything, beauty is everything,, because they because they are the beautiful ones have a a choice..they get to pick which they want, ",1

No time for petty romance and feelings in real tough life.

15027,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Mangina.,1
15028,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Excellent talk. We constantly judge people based on physical Characteristics. The one thing beyond their control. And the least accurate test of character. The modelling industry objectifies... but so does society as a whole. Both are in dire need of change.,1
15029,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was good. I think it should have been longer though. I think more people should talk about the subject/science of attractiveness because it affects/motivates us more than we think.,1

15033,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She can&#39;t decide how others will treat her. Most of what she has in her life has been given to her as she said. Now that she&#39;s a model, finding a professional career seems out of her scope. She&#39;s not protesting the modeling industry, she&#39;s giving people on the outside a chance to see what really goes on in the inside. She&#39;s just trying to get the point across that she didn&#39;t work to become a model and that girls who aspire to be how she looks in magazines should reconsider their judgement.",1

15048,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"To be honest, I was drawn in by her compassion and what would seem like her guilt at being beautiful. During her talk I kept thinking that she had no reason to feel guilty about being born beautiful and using it to put herself through college, but what I later felt was that for as much as she talked about being privileged because of a social dictate and how most people will never have that option, she doesn&#39;t hesitate to use it again to launch some other kind of career (maybe humanitarian?). pt1",1

She stands on the pinnacle of what popular society deems to be attractive, but by doing so, she also must keep a fine balance, the world is watching, and we are ever so keen to tear down those who have benefited from the genetic lottery.

Such is her life.

15081,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Maybe she could install a microphone in her mouth and have someone talk for her also?,1
15082,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Exactly my point she has much value as a dead body as a living person. You prop up a dead body and take a photo of it and she&#39;d have contributed just as much to society. What rational person would pay a woman who&#39;s bringing profit to their business 17% less than a male? If a woman knew her value was worth 17% more she would just go to another employer. If someone&#39;s being paid less it&#39;s because they&#39;re content with it or incompetent. Greed surpasses prejudice.,1

15102,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hypocrite to say that it&#39;s unfair but to not want to take away your own advantage. I would think she&#39;s a hypocrite if she had a shoot, could choose an extra person, the best one is a black person and yet she chooses a white person. 
Even in that case I wouldn&#39;t find it hypocritical to choose a white person if that person was the best. 
Also I find the shame on you very unneeded. ",1
15103,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I understand what she is talking about but its not going to change anytime soon. the more we look at the level of confidence we have as Americans, it goes down drastically. People will also find faults in themselves, but its our jobs to make sure our strengths show and I would have liked her to touch on that.",1
15104,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think I love her,1

15107,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She pretty much said she won the genetic lottery.  She gets loads of credit for acknowledging it.  As for not liking it, how would you feel if your success in your field were due to factors completely out of your control like appearance?  ",1
15108,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"There&#39;s no such thing as an ugly woman who can pose beautifully. Any posing or walking or &quot;holding your hand up&quot; is shit anyone can do. She won the lottery plain and simple. She doesn&#39;t deserve credit for shit. If a crack addict wins the lotto she he be called an accomplished man? Fuck her, she doesn&#39;t deserve shit. She profited from a caste system and has the gull to say doesn&#39;t like it. ",1
15109,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I&#39;m with you.,1
15110,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Andrew I&#39;m with you man. She didn&#39;t just win a genetic lottery, she was born into a caste system. People who don&#39;t look like her are second class citizens. Women are incapable of admitting anything.",1
15111,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"by the way, the fashion industry does NOT cater to mostly white people and in Africa, have you ever heard of apartheid ? Yes, where black people were forced to be second class citizens and slaves in their OWN country ? And in all of North Africa when the French wasted themselves upon Arabs in hopes for more territory....there are still French who say, &quot;we lost Algeria to the savage natives....&quot; Were you mentioning THAT racism ?
",1
15112,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yea.  MTV n FTV delusion.,1
15113,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Dude you&#39;re pointing out HOMEGENIZED countries. Would you like to know what that means ? It means that those countries are NOT diverse in population, that yes in Jamaica there are mainly blacks. In Japan, there are mainly Japanese and in Nigeria, you guessed it, there are mainly black people. So of course they are going to have mainly people of their race on t.v. AMERICA, FRANCE, BRITAIN..all countries that are DIVERSE and should therefore have more healthy representation of that in their media.",1
15114,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just because you want to do something doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll be good at it. Just because you&#39;re good at something doesn&#39;t mean you want to do it. At a very early point in life I knew that I was better at picking up and doing creative skills then most people. I&#39;m just happy that it&#39;s something I wanted to dedicate my life to. If you were given a gift would you not use it to better your life if you could? If I was hot I&#39;d totally use that to make money, but I then I might not be as good at doing art.",1
15115,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,now i want to become a model,1
15116,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I respect your mangina.,1
15117,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I thought she was going to get somewhere...,1

15121,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Awesome point. America is a white country.  only like 4% of the American population is non-white, and who really counts those people as American anyway?",1
15122,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Exactly. She&#39;s the typical gemini hypocrite. Double faced.,1
15123,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;Looks are not important&quot;. Said the bikini model xD,1
15124,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You don&#39;t think it has power for the hundreds of women out there that are insecure and for the many young girls this could be shared with? Might be a waste of time to you, but it isn&#39;t to everyone.",1
15125,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"well perhaps someday you may understand that its not about material wealth,fame or respect, it is about self accomplishment and self fulfillment. ",1
15126,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why did you say we must end racism in africa??? Why choosing africa??? You must be racist and negrophobic ;),1
15127,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,But hey - He&#39;s right!  I&#39;m sure the amount of televisions needed to keep the Chinese population from toppling their dictator must be mountainous.,1
15128,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I honestly don&#39;t get this one, she&#39;s a model but she&#39;s like everyone else?? Haa Iguess.",1
15129,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t get her fucking point. Everything she complained about makes her life easier. Free dress cool. Got out of a ticket. Sweet. This is all shit everybody wants and only people with looks get these things. So why sit here and complain about it?,1
15130,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I see not many people give her the respect she needs. It took courage to talk about that and make factual statements. Yeah, she is hot, but the message she brings is the main attraction",1
15131,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What was the point? , models are insecure.. Anyone can be?",1
15132,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t fomd the tall, slender look attractive.",1
15133,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think i have a Ted talk which is money isn&#39;t everything, i&#39;m trump. lol no it was a good talk.",1
15134,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"insecure, honest answer
",1
15135,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,me too.,1
15136,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Enuff said. And what&#39;s funny is that your comment got too many thumbs down and got disabled. Speaks a lot about the brainwashed masses.,1
15137,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You&#39;re too cynical. Her presentation is a good counter-point against the common idea that models live &quot;amazing&quot; lives. Her presentation isn&#39;t profound, but still a good message. ",1
15138,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Okay, you&#39;re right -- I went back and she doesn&#39;t mention america specifically. But that makes your argument make less sense. She&#39;s saying 96% of models are white, and you&#39;re saying they&#39;re underrepresented??",1
15139,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why does the model industry in china have to match the &quot;global&quot; diversity? The &quot;global&quot; diversity should be matched by the &quot;global&quot; modelling industry as a whole (all the models from all the countries put together), whereas each country&#39;s models should match its own demographics. Doesn&#39;t that make sense? Why would you make 50% of the models white in China when white people make up a very small minority in China? ",1
15140,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"on the flipside though, I&#39;m sure it can mess with someone to get unwarranted freebies all your life just based on your looks...as impossible as that sounds when the grass is greener on the other side",1
15141,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"basically what she&#39;s saying is &quot;boo-hoo, I&#39;m hot&quot;",1
15142,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"China IS like 99.9% Chinese. Well, I don&#39;t know the actual statistic, but I&#39;ll come back to what I said before: the United States is a multicultural country. China is not. I don&#39;t doubt that there is racism is China, but that&#39;s not the point. Why do we need to compare ourselves to China when trying to determine if there&#39;s a problem? By your logic, as long as other countries are worse, we don&#39;t need to worry about it. Let China worry about China and the U.S worry about the U.S. ",1
15143,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,loved the insight!,1
15144,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Following your logic would imply that the modelling community is naturally white dominated. There&#39;s no reason why that should be the case.,1
15145,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Taking time to resolve a conflict of opinions can actually be pretty educational and fulfilling and helps gain perspective.  Also doesn&#39;t take really any effort.  *shruggin*,1
15146,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So you&#39;d rather we didn&#39;t feel sorry for ourselves, and ignore the fact that we&#39;re one group who usually manages to avoid discrimination?    ",1
15147,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Respect.,1
15148,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The point is, the United States is a more racially diverse country than Nigeria or Japan. If it were all (or mostly) white as a nation, it wouldn&#39;t be a problem that only 4% of models were non-white, but the U.S. is in fact 27% non-white as a whole. The fact that the beauty industry doesn&#39;t reflect this indicates a racially-biased perception of what is beautiful. ",1
15149,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It wasn&#39;t said that they were any better than anybody else--you&#39;re the only one to say that here. Here it was said, essentially, that they&#39;re unjustly discriminated in favor of. ",1
15150,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I see your point, but leaving modelling in her case isn&#39;t going to make the industry go away. I think being in the position she&#39;s in gives her more power to influence girls&#39; perceptions, because she has the authority of someone on the inside. For that reason, I think she&#39;s able to make a bigger difference this way, than if she were to simply give up modelling. ",1
15151,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Are you sure she plans on continuing for the rest of her life?  Maybe she&#39;s under contract.  Maybe she plans to do something else very soon.   Maybe she&#39;s doing things for those she spoke about, without actually saying so during this talk, because if she had done so, there&#39;d be online critics chastising her for that too.  Maybe it&#39;s okay for a model to say she isn&#39;t completely satisfied with her profession.
",1
15152,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That&#39;s such a disingenuous thing to say, no different than chastising the U.S. President for taking measures to restrict the supply of automatic weapons, by saying he should go around without the Secret Service.  Please think more deeply about why you either just don&#39;t like her, or don&#39;t agree with the substance of her talk.   She spoke for over 9 minutes, and I heard her make several substantive points, not all of which I agreed with, but points nonetheless.",1
15153,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The thing is... EVERYONE thinks about what they look like everyday... No shit attractiveness doesn&#39;t equal happiness, but to be honest, winning the &#39;genetic lottery&#39; just gives you an extra career path if all else fails. If she wanted to be a scientist, or work in politics or be a lawyer or a doctor, she can do all those things... AND if all else fails, she can be a damn supermodel... Everyone else has the same problems but doesn&#39;t have a fall back.",1
15154,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what are you saying man?,1
15155,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,yeah but she continues to pursue her modelling career despite knowing about the negative effects of these images on teenage girls. that gets minus respect points from me and thus thumbs down on this video.,1
15156,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Powerful.,1
15157,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,smart model.. thats nice for a change!,1
15158,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"4:48 Whenever I see a walking shot now, I will think of that part.",1
15159,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I noticed she didn&#39;t take off her makeup.
",1
15160,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Stupid woman with absolutely nothing to say. Absolute bullshit. ,1
15161,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Having an opinion, is like having an ass hole, everyone has one... It never seem to amaze me how people can get so emotionally invested in someone else form or style of expression. It does not matter If your doing good or bad people are always going to have something to say. Relax!!! how does her doing her effect you doing you? Exactly... get over it, or get a therapist. Peace",1
15162,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s incredibly brave - her internal beauty outshines her exterior.,1
15163,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she is a smart woman.  She made a mint off of being beautiful to societal standards...she paid for college....she is well spoken.  Just because you are beautiful does not mean that you have everything...but it definately doesn&#39;t hurt!  She is saying she is lucky to win the genetic lotto...and also that the pictures she is in are very calculated and she used it to her advantage, but she doesn&#39;t take herself so serious as a model either.  She used it and it worked for her.",1
15164,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Maybe you just have low standards ,1
15165,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Gibememoni, please fuck off with your ignorance",1
15166,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,wow you guys have no lives...,1
15167,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I prefer cute girls around 5&#39; 6&quot; range.  I would go on a date with the girl next door before a tall under weight &quot;super&quot; model. ,1
15168,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Actually they do. But the point here is about image in general and how much it stacks a deck, how you can go to jail based on looks, and how being so image conscious eats at the self esteem. The talk is to give a different way to look at the world and that is TED. :) ",1
15169,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Love her!,1
15170,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,We&#39;ve all done stuff in our past that the older us wouldn&#39;t approve of or would like to change.,1
15171,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"very little of TED is science.  And if you were to expand the definition of science, then this is a social science talk.

glad to see you gone.",1
15172,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I liked the message in this video so I &quot;liked&quot; it, then immediately felt guilty and wondered if the reason I just &quot;liked&quot; it was influenced by the fact that she was pretty... ",1
15173,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You have to remember that she was most likely 14~17 at the time. She&#39;s now approaching 30. 

Can you really blame a girl for not having the maturity to realize what was going on back then? 

I would applaud her for being truthful about it as she has grown up.",1
15174,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ah, see it came off as sort of a &quot;Hey look at how good of a person I am I put down women who happen to fall into our society&#39;s standard of attractive!&quot; thing.  You see a lot of people looking for brownie points for that these days.  It&#39;s hard to convey your point on the internet sometimes, but I do see your point now and agree with it.",1
15175,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why don&#39;t you fat, short little stubby chubby minorities go make your own fashion show if you hate the &quot;european&quot; version of beauty? Most high fashion clothes are made in EUROPE, you know...for EUROPEANS TO WEAR. Go model for baby phat or sean john if you don&#39;t like it.",1
15176,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Nice combination, Beauty and Smart",1
15177,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I really like how personal this talk was,1
15178,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bye,1
15179,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Art is still subjective.  And ah I see your point about what she said about the standard of beauty and her comments on that were inaccurate I agree.  But this is branching off into something completely different from your original comment which was commenting solely on her appearance.  Perhaps your intention was meant to address what you wrote about these past several comments, but you solely only talked about her appearance in your first one.",1
15180,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She seems pretty assumptive. Most of the gist of the talk seems to be &quot;I&#39;m a model, but I secretly hate my job, so you should probably assume that other models secretly hate their jobs too.&quot;",1
15181,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think you&#39;re reading my comments in the wrong order.,1
15182,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Geez!  Another self loathing model....she felt so bad about her looks but she STILL took the FREE dress from the shop, still drove away in the car w/out a ticket and didn&#39;t have a problem with it at the time.??  We all can&#39;t be models but we ALL have something unique to each of us and can use it to our advantage in life.",1
15183,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"See now you have made it a you vs me thing. And those are conversations I don&#39;t get involved with, especially over the internet. You can never fully articulate yourself and your opinions, and things get misconstrued. I&#39;m even starting to see that based on what you&#39;ve told me. So Imma step out.",1
15184,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Next year, more than 50% of babies born in America will be minorities. And even in these other countries that you mentioned, the models the people look at will often still be white because America and Europe dominate the fashion industry. Im not saying that&#39;s a huge crisis or anything, but her point still doesn&#39;t deserve to be mocked.  ",1
15185,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Compare that to the population of people in Jamaica that are non-black, Compare that to population of Japanese that non-Japanese... That is the difference.",1
15186,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good now, we&#39;re getting somewhere, instead of throwing out blanket accusations of hatred on other people&#39;s part and giving her a free pass on criticism we are now getting to specifics. Yes &quot;you are too skinny to make sense&quot; is not criticism, but until you started giving examples there was no way to no what you specifically  you were finding hateful. About my criticism, So if it&#39;s legitimate but not hypocrisy, what would you call it?",1
15187,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Given that you yourself have said what she said was obvious, someone calling it a &quot;waste of time&quot; is not hating, it is both honest and truthfull. Given that she has made a living on her looks, it would be rich of her or you to object to criticism&#39;s of her looks. If accusations of hatred are permissible, accusations of self-interest are permissible. Criticisms are valid on their own merits.",1
15188,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i liked her talk ..,1
15189,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well that&#39;s a legitimate criticism, and that is besides my point. (Even though I disagree that it is hipocrisy) It&#39;s not one sided. &quot;You&#39;re too skinny to make sense&quot; is NOT criticism. Are you starting to see my point?",1
15190,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Everything&#39;s a matter of perception.,1
15191,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You didn&#39;t watch the whole video.. did you?,1
15192,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good talk. Brave of her to speak so plainly.    
Smart is the real sexy.  ",1
15193,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You one sided analysis of her vs the &quot;haters&quot; didn&#39;t even touch her hypocrisy of slagging of her industry whilst having profited from it (It&#39;s unclear if she still is),1
15194,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Well because you can&#39;t take just 1/2 of the package. They&#39;re talking honestly, but to induce hatred. They have said nothing. The comments I&#39;ve seen if you look below are &quot;This is a waste of time&quot; &quot;Her legs look like broom handles&quot; &quot;She&#39;s not even that hot&quot; &quot;She just wants to talk about herself&quot; You don&#39;t hear things like &quot;She makes a good point, but...&quot; &quot;I disagree with...&quot; or things along those lines. Honesty alone is nothing commendable. This is just hateful language.",1
15195,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Money makes it so you don&#39;t have those additional little problems in life. You can just decide to go to Italy whenever you want, you don&#39;t have to worry whether you should pay for gas or food for that day, but you still have all those personal problems like fights with the wife, your kids don&#39;t listen to you, etc. Money would not make me happy, but, it would give me the time to focus on the happiness of myself &amp; loved ones.",1
15196,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You answered only half my point, the other half is, why is other people talking frankly hating? That&#39;s a different concept than not being courageous.",1
15197,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Carl Sagan is a person whose outsides reflect her inner beauty. I liked the talk, it wasn&#39;t revolutionary or ground breaking but it was very honest &amp; I love honesty.",1
15198,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,A self-absorbed bore.,1
15199,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not to mention that she is coming out in person, and exposing something not so positive about her own career path. Posting something negative about my career path with no videos under the pseudonym &quot;LilDP&quot; will not likely put my career at risk. I can hate all I want, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s courageous to do so.",1
15200,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"For such a topic, only a model will be listened to when addressing this. ",1
15201,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Because what she says isn&#39;t scathing... very simple. In fact it takes no courage to say I don&#39;t like her behind a computer screen. But it takes BALLS, to go up in front of a massive audience (larger than the venue itself), not to mention a potentially hostile audience full of the &quot;Scientific Elite&quot; and talk about something so &quot;mundane&quot; as modeling. And the great thing is that she is aware of this and admits this. That&#39;s courage and honesty..",1
15202,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,EASY MEAT!!!  (Frank Zappa)  I&#39;m just kidding around... Don&#39;t get all in a fruff....  :)  ,1
15203,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I am not sure what part of the world you are from, but in the western media, it is.  Note that she is talking about the media.  And usually if you make unwarranted comments on someone&#39;s appearance, it is considered very rude.  Also, her profession is a model.  It&#39;s like telling an artist &quot;You&#39;re not that good at painting, I can name 5 artists better than you.&quot;  I feel like we&#39;re not going to agree here, but in the future I encourage you to think about what you say about someone before you say it",1
15204,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"hey dummy, TED stands for technology, entertainment, and design, not &quot;science&quot;",1
15205,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"money isn&#39;t everything. believe me, I&#39;m a millionaire.",1
15206,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This was a really good talk. She&#39;s refreshingly honest - I think more models would like to say what they really feel about the industry but they are afraid they will lose work. You can tell this is all very personal to her, and I think she makes a lot of interesting points.",1
15207,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think thats one of her points, modelling happened to her at a young age, and she is introspecting about how its a culture that breeds insecurity rather than empowerment personally, and the power these images do wield is superficial and distorted.",1
15208,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Because once a vid hits 300 views, Youtube freezes the count so they can verify that the views weren&#39;t created by dubious means (bots, etc.....).

You see this on nearly any recent, popular video.",1
15209,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"My prejudices may have wanted me to instantly dislike her but her honesty made me listen and I have to say she is very intelligent in that she has lived a life of privilege and she has seen what it got her and through that she has come to understand what it means to not be privileged, which isn&#39;t something people in her position think of often! 
And she realised true fulfillment in life doesn&#39;t come from wealth and fame but from meaning!",1
15210,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"YOU didn&#39;t LISTEN to what she had to SAY because YOU were too DISTRACTED by her LOOKS.
Congratulations!!! You just proved her point.",1
15211,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"So when she speaks her mind frankly it&#39;s &quot;truthfully and courageous&quot; but when other people do it, that&#39;s &quot;hating&quot;?",1
15212,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"OR..... You could mind your own business, and come up with your own original thoughts. Instead of glamming onto me.... btw.  ",1
15213,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"...It&#39;s tedTALKS TED FUCKING TALKS, and you&#39;re mad because they upload people talking?!?!",1
15214,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Exactly. Hardly any videos get this amount of views and conversation. Its shows that people feel uncomfortable watching this video and realizing their own prejudices.
As a 20 year old male at first glance i saw - to be blunt - a walking womb carrier.",1
15215,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Hating someone for being a white girl is just as bad as hating a man for being black. ,1
15216,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I really understand what she&#39;s saying. I&#39;m not a model but I did win the lottery so to speak and I do feel guilty for it. I want people to judge me for who I am but most of the time they can&#39;t get past the way I look, it&#39;s quite a lonely existence.",1
15217,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Why are people hating? No, her talk is not mindblowing or revolutionary. Yes, she is nervous and awkward. But she is speaking truthfully and courageously, and she is right.",1
15218,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That fact that you say that just shows how oblivious you are to the rest of the world. There&#39;s more to life than just science.. The world works the way it does because of all the little things put together that form a bigger picture. Be it Technology, business, whatever. The whole point of TED is to spread the knowledge of everything to everyone.",1
15219,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Are you sure you have no emotional investment? How many times have you commented on this video? Just saying, perhaps some perspective or reflection might be in order. ",1
15220,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Raising questions is a fundamental part of learning. XD,1
15221,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was really beautiful.,1
15222,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good talk, I was sceptical are first but I see where she is coming from. I give it to her for admitting the truth about herself. More kids need to hear this and understand how superficial that kind of life can be...

I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on in the comments though, what&#39;s with all the trolling?",1
15223,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,how could a person watching ted talks ask such a question? views take a lot ore time to update!,1
15224,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I like the way the view count just proved what she said. Only because of the title so many people watched it in such a short time since it was uploaded...,1
15225,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t know enough about modelling or runway modelling, although I&#39;ve seen androgynous looking runway models (as of recently, if my memory serves me correctly), but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. Likewise, they--whoever they is--have been manipulating if not manufacturing the ideas of masculinity and femininity for decades, too. For instance, look at the progression of action figures and dolls, specifically Barbie dolls. The whole thing is pretty insane, if you think about it.",1
15226,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,That was incredible. Best talk I&#39;ve seen in a while.,1
15227,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,YouTube is slow in updating the views compared to the likes... I know it doesn&#39;t make sense but YouTube has always worked like that :P,1
15228,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I see. carry on then :D,1
15229,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You&#39;ve missed my point.  My comment was tongue-in-cheek.  I am saying the same thing you are.,1
15230,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Admirable courage
",1
15231,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think Laartu was aiming for irony...,1
15232,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just a question: how can this video have 300 views and 900 likes?
",1
15233,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Im sorry but you dont need to be intelligent to be a model. And thats it.
Infact almost all of the models have no education at all, Im not suprised that this girl is already tired of people thinking she is not intelligent because of its looks.",1
15234,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I didn&#39;t find her attractive. I don&#39;t find most models attractive. For some reason they don&#39;t really look like women. Normal girls for me &gt; models ,1
15235,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is enlightening a very interesting topic. 8:35 on wards that is an extremely good part of the talk. I salute this girl and glad that she was able to give a talk. Although I admit that this could have been done in a more direct and efficient manner, still i commend her.",1
15236,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you&#39;re not understanding what harpdevil is saying,1
15237,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"lmao, me too",1
15238,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She believes in evolution!! Great!,1
15239,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That statement is so incredibly far off in regards to the Ted community, try looking through the most popular ted talks and think about revising your opinion.",1
15240,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"this comes off as her tooting her own horn and making cringeworthy jokes to try to be funny. cameron, do you not realize that the modeling pictures of you that are published are part of the reason why teenage girls feel insecure about their looks?",1
15241,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good for her. Takes a vagina to swallow your pride and shout what others probably already think about you. If she was a Plus size model, I wonder if anyone would have laughed at her jokes.",1
15242,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Wow, keep the cycle going if it makes you feel good.",1
15243,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"If people think this is a good ted talk because she&#39;s a&quot;pretty white girl&quot; why is that &quot;absolutely disgusting&quot;? Don&#39;t be so quick to assume that people who liked the ted talk are shallow and stupid. Also I would say that it&#39;s Because she is a model that this is interesting, hearing someone who is superficially portrayed talk about another aspect. That being said it is fairly obvious most models aren&#39;t just plastic barbies.",1
15244,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,There&#39;s a lot of people out there that doesn&#39;t even get the obvious.,1
15245,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;You aren&#39;t even that hot.  I could find five guys that don&#39;t look like you that are hotter than you.&quot;  Seems a bit hurtful to say doesn&#39;t it?,1
15246,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,nice,1
15247,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,So says the guy who insults a stranger&#39;s looks.,1
15248,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Well first of all personal taste is subjective.  Second of all he tears down this woman&#39;s appearance and then claims &quot;true beauty comes from inner confidence&quot;.  I think that&#39;s just a tad bit messed up.,1
15249,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Thank you beautiful. Real beauty is within,1
15250,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Carl Sagan would be ashamed of your limited scope of knowledge. ,1
15251,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,then maybe we should save our pity for the people who deserve it,1
15252,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,agree,1
15253,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You will be judged by your looks. It&#39;s the oldest surviving human tradition. Some people seem outraged by that. Don&#39;t be outraged, you can&#39;t change human nature.  ",1
15254,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you&#39;ve reeeaally never heard that before?,1
15255,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,obviously the latter (on average).  ,1
15256,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"sometimes i like popcorn, true story",1
15257,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Poor girl, hope life&#39;s not too hard on her! lol.  ",1
15258,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Is he wrong?,1
15259,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A well balanced talk worth listening to.. I&#39;ve never heard anyone speak about how we should credit our own successes and failures to our looks. It easy to look externally and point out where others have succeeded due to being considered handsome or pretty. However, we subconsciously do this all the time ourselves. ",1
15260,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Being on the other side doesn&#39;t make it any better, whether it be skinny girls or curvy girls you are still making a judgement on the girl dependent on her body. Of course we have qualities we are attracted to, but praising one doesn&#39;t mean we should condemn the other. ",1
15261,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the problem is it&#39;s all stuff we all knew already. a waste of time that people only care about because she&#39;s pretty. I&#39;ve worked for a company I didn&#39;t believe in too, do I deserve a medal?",1
15262,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Funny how impolite people can be when they can hide behind an internet veil, isn&#39;t it?",1
15263,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Let&#39;s hope she and others like her talk more on the subject then!,1
15264,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Listen to this talk without video... actually, don&#39;t waste you time at all.",1
15265,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Do you want a medal?,1
15266,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she didn&#39;t say anything that everyone didn&#39;t already know,1
15267,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She made a lot of good points that a lot of people needed to hear, why are you discriminating against her because of her looks?",1
15268,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,If she was real brave she would quit the job and expose publicly exactly why she quited her job. But because she hasnt quit that makes her an hypocrite.,1
15269,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"no, it&#39;s a bad ted talk because everything she said was obvious.",1
15270,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"when did I say I hate whites? I just pointed out that you seem to be congratulating her on her white guilt, when that&#39;s a much easier thing to live with than the struggle of actually being a minority.",1
15271,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I feel Toilethack is right that media has no effect on our taste.  HOWEVER, it does have an effect on how we feel about those tastes.  If the media tells us that skinny white people are pretty then we are going to be insecure and feel like there&#39;s something wrong with us. or if they show these impossibly shiny buff men that no one really is attracted to, men might think &quot;should I look like that?&quot; because the media tells them thats what partners find attractive.  It changes how we view ourselves.",1
15272,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was just pretty poor in general...TED?,1
15273,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"She is great , I think she is honest and very brave ! GO GIRL! ",1
15274,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"gee, I wonder if it&#39;s harder to be a white person with white guilt or a non-white person?",1
15275,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"This is sobering, honest, and humble. Thank you for your insight.

In medias, nothing is real, everything is intentionally constructed.",1
15276,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I do think super models and models like her are not &#39;&#39;sexy&#39;&#39; in my eyes, I dont like bones but meat, not neceserelly obese or fat though, it can be simply bigger bones with bigger boddy and bigger muscles. 
Calm me a chubby chaser, or  an Ancient Greek descendent lol
",1
15277,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"That statement is factually incorrect. They don&#39;t want us all to have the same taste, that would be silly. All it does is make it easier for opponents to fill in that niche. Besides that people are more vocal and convinced about their choices if they are surrounded by people who made different choices. e.g apple",1
15278,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Bravo! Excellent video. I appreciate your honesty.,1
15279,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"of course it does.
I&#39;m exposed to that same &quot;propaganda&quot;. I don&#39;t like all the things they&#39;re trying to sell me, and I don&#39;t buy them. People are responsible for themselves and their own decisions. It is cowardly to try to blame industries for our own faults.",1
15280,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"But because of the effect of propaganda that media, films and beauty industry does, it has nothing to do with our natural and different tastes that we have.",1
15281,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the industry does drive our tastes a bit, but we also drive the industry. industry isn&#39;t going to make any money if they sell us something we don&#39;t want. you can&#39;t just blame the industry - it&#39;s obvious we want it, too.",1
15282,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Good talk until 0:55 -- I joke. :),1
15283,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Poor girl.  Must be tough to have to think about all the problems associated with your attractiveness every day.  Admitting white guilt doesn&#39;t negate it.  ,1
15284,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Is that a joke? Did you listen to the talk at all?,1
15285,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You say &#39;&#39;society is the problem&#39;&#39;, it is the industry, media and corporations that drives the society to have certain tastes so they can &#39;&#39;control&#39;&#39; us.
",1
15286,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,insert Picard-meme here ^^,1
15287,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,your closed-minded jab actually was a bit uncalled for.   Nobody ever said TED was only about science.  All the guy said was he missed science themed videos.  Fact of the matter is there are almost none lately.  It is not closed-minded to not value a fluff talk void of substance.  That&#39;s what most TED talks are these days.  TED seems to have become a marketing for folks on book tours.  You don&#39;t need a closed mind to see it,1
15288,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I didn&#39;t really expected her to have any sense of humor,1
15289,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,all stuff we all knew before,1
15290,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Yes. Good riddance. Don&#39;t let the door hit you on the way out!,1
15291,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Yes, I do",1
15292,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,it goes both ways. the industry is also driven by the consumer,1
15293,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Your reply was worthy of an applause. I wish all people on YouTube commented like you, and not in an aggressive and extremely impolite way. *clap clap clap*",1
15294,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"not really. I don&#39;t see the point of sports. I&#39;m good at the things I value, and I think the things I&#39;m good at ARE important (creativity, math/science). Art and science are our legacy, as individuals and as a society.",1
15295,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Contemporary models don&#39;t look like any definition of beauty at any point of history.  The androgynous look and the herion chic look was created in the early &#39;80&#39;s,1
15296,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It might not be the best talk, but it did have substance. ",1
15297,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"okay, she&#39;s won genetic lottery ticket. and most of us don&#39;t, stop complaining. go and become a president instead of a model. she&#39;s hot, deal with it. ",1
15298,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I have a strong reaction against her, but I don&#39;t desire to be her. My reaction against her is a frustration with society&#39;s fascination for the things she embodies. that means less people are worth talking to, and less media is created for people like me in mind. the strong reaction stems from a worthless talk. if she had something not obvious and worthwhile to say, I would very much enjoy the talk, and have in the past. you really think if the talk was worthwhile she&#39;d still get this backlash?",1
15299,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Idiot, nobody is making you listen to a lecture on ideas.  If you don&#39;t want to listen to it then go away and let everyone else enjoy themselves.",1
15300,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"A nice message, nonetheless.",1
15301,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Thats what exaclty I thought after viewing this video, I think this industry is forcing us to have all the same taste, but why.",1
15302,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"All I get from this talk is &quot;It&#39;s true I&#39;m in the 0.00001% but it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m happy&quot;. So basically she came clean about being a spoiled brat ? Enjoy your life model, some other people can&#39;t...",1
15303,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,he was implying* TED no longer hosts or uploads talks about science or enough talks about science**,1
15304,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I doubt it. In fact, look at some of the strong reactions against her. Even the level of emotion is because we love to hate the beautiful people, while at the same time desiring to be one of them or to at least bask in their glory.",1
15305,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,painful to watch,1
15306,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I worked for a company I didn&#39;t believe in too. In fact, the product it put out was what I thought was wrong with the industry. The company recently tanked and I&#39;m glad of it. I&#39;m a talented person - I will land on my feet just fine. I&#39;m just glad to see that this reflects on the industry, that you can&#39;t get away with putting garbage out there. I&#39;m glad to see evidence that my faith in society shouldn&#39;t bottom out completely.",1
15307,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I was wondering that. Perhaps it was cut out...,1
15308,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What runway models or models in general look like nowadays is NOT how &quot;we have defined beauty for the last two centuries.&quot; And who is &quot;we,&quot; anyway?",1
15309,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;I&#39;m sure she would be glad the day that the fashion industry died&quot; lol, sure.",1
15310,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great talk, very valuable. I hope it makes rounds on the web.",1
15311,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what a fuckin bullshit,1
15312,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Poor thing...?,1
15313,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,HAHAHHAHA,1
15314,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"the difference is she is not PERPETUATING the problem. superficiality will be there whether she&#39;s the one who benefits from it or not. the problem is society. I&#39;m sure she would be glad the day that the fashion industry died, but for now, she has something that other people will buy. if they are superficial enough to want to buy it, it&#39;s their own faults, not hers.",1
15315,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"like I said, there&#39;s nothing else about this video to like. she is stating the obvious. I have liked what beautiful people have said before, because what they said was worthwhile. this entire talk is a platitude.
I appreciate your concern for my life but I find a lot of fulfillment in it. But society as a whole is a waste of time, and it is a shame.",1
15316,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,What was she saying? I was busy masturbating.,1
15317,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,ahaha,1
15318,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i most probably wouldn&#39;t but at least i would be an hypocrite like this woman. 
&quot;the system is unfair!&quot; ..and then takes advantage of the system for her own profit. 
Shame on you for not seeing the obvious.",1
15319,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she didnt make any points....other than &#39;being beautiful and getting things doesnt make you happy&#39;   and why was the black and latino arrest thing mentioned and then not expanded on. she created the framework to make some great points but didnt finish them off,1
15320,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Just as I suspected, your pathetic life IS filled with hate.

The title of the video is &quot;Looks aren&#39;t everything&quot;, and you are thinking people like this video because its a hot chic. Wow. You need help.",1
15321,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Big Balls.,1
15322,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t hate my life, I hate society. I hate that people are so impressed with a completely worthless TED talk because the girl is pretty. I hate people&#39;s fascination with the superficial, the boring, the formulaic, and the stupid. It makes it so very few people are worth talking to, and very little media is worth consuming.",1
15323,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"what are you talking about? she&#39;s in a profession she requires no skill for, and realizes she is being rewarded based on society&#39;s ugly fascination with the superficial, and being white.",1
15324,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why do you hate your life so much that you spend your free time trolling people on YouTube? Lets explore this. What kind of trauma in your life let you to this low?,1
15325,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what are you even saying,1
15326,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol She basically says right in the talk that modeling requires no skill.,1
15327,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wait a minute.. how did she get her first job or pay for college?? ,1
15328,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This is a main fact. Cursory beauty is espousing inner beauty. But only inner beauty is real beauty - that everybody can see. Inner beauty is ingredient of emphatie-perceptions.,1
15329,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I know that you found this captivating. there really isn&#39;t another group of people that could say that about this video outside of morons.,1
15330,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"My biggest complain is that this talk should have been longer. I feel she had just warmed up. So yeah, a 20 minute talk and it would maybe be interesting, this talk was just meh.",1
15331,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You really think so?,1
15332,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Self absorbed.... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. What place does this have on TED.... This one for the recycle bin.....,1
15333,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,this is awesome,1
15334,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"you know literally nothing about me, but have determined im a moron?

LOL, delete your account. Now.",1
15335,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she&#39;s pretty funny,1
15336,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,agree,1
15337,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what part of stating the obvious would you describe as clever?,1
15338,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t care that she accepts her beauty was luck .. doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s qualified for TED. ,1
15339,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Clever girl :),1
15340,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I appreciate that she&#39;s using her position to try and &#39;make a change&#39;, but if she dislikes the industry as much as she appears to, + doesn&#39;t like being in a job that only highlights her insecurities daily... then why continue to be a model?  Hmm. =/",1
15341,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Well there goes the windows again! Please lower the volume TED.,1
15342,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,but ... but ... i wanted to see how many people stood up in the audience at the end ....,1
15343,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what for? stating the obvious?,1
15344,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,babe with a brain ,1
15345,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Calm down dude. My point is that he was inferring that TED is only about science and technology, but the topics covered are much more broad than that. It seems narrow-minded to me to only view one topic when the TED experience is about being open-minded and hearing other people&#39;s ideas and unique experiences.You don&#39;t have to necessarily agree with or enjoy all the presentations, but you can at least consider them and listen.",1
15346,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,You is talking loco and I like it! ,1
15347,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Who else Google Image Cameron Russell straight after?,1
15348,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"becuse moisture is the essence of wetness, and wetness is the essence of beauty. ",1
15349,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"what kinda man likes girls with thinner thighs wtf, ",1
15350,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Awesome! She is right on. Much respect to her and TED.

15351,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Or zombies..,1
15352,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a lot more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking. And I plan on finding out what that is.  -Derek Zoolander",1
15353,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,lol wtf it&#39;s not all about science,1
15354,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,cause she&#39;s beautiful and feels bad that people treat her better because of that,1
15355,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I watched this video because there was an attractive female on the thumbnail.,1
15356,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,or you could address the bullshit you&#39;re spouting. why is someone &quot;gay&quot; just because they don&#39;t like a talk given by someone who is an attractive female?,1
15357,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,you are easily amused,1
15358,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,and you&#39;re a moron,1
15359,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,TED is not about science it is about ideas whether its a new theory on evolution or How you think certain people are treated it doesn&#39;t matter as long as its worth spreading which this was ( just about. granted I usually watch the science and tech stuff but your being a jackass),1
15360,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yyyeeaaah, and I&#39;m judged all the time for my work as an artist to see whether or not I&#39;m going to get the job. how&#39;s this any different? what&#39;s your point?",1
15361,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,This was captivating.,1
15362,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she doesnt look like 16 at all. ,1
15363,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Would have loved to hear her delve deeper into the reality of one of the largest industries on the planet; the beauty industry. The fact is, models are constantly judged and rejected because of their looks, for every acceptance there are a hundred jobs they don&#39;t get, and they are utterly disposable. If you&#39;re smart enough, you can learn how to game the system and take the rejection in stride. And it isn&#39;t always beautiful; behind the scenes it rarely is. ",1
15364,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"and why is that? my feminism? my intolerance of the boring and stupid? or is it because all straight males are like me, because, once again, we can all be grouped together like that? why is it okay for you to hate all guys but you have a problem when people dismiss all girls?
you have some shit to sort out in your head, lady. don&#39;t let this stuff cook in there for too long, lest you become a hateful hypocrite.",1
15365,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Aww, poor little rich girl.",1

15370,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"what part of anything I said makes you think I&#39;m dismissive of women? this sounds more like insecurity on your part. I spend much of my time complaining to friends about how women are depicted in the media, so I very much resent your assumption that every man in the world is a pig. maybe you&#39;re right - if you&#39;re not understanding something as basic as &quot;not every guy is a chauvinist&quot;, maybe we DO need some of the obvious stuff reiterated.",1
15371,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i know what your mean bro,1
15372,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"what the fuck, how is this the best talk ever?",1
15373,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I don&#39;t think this was a bad talk however it think at the end the final conclusion wasn&#39;t very clear. Were was she trying to go with &quot;image is power&quot; we all know that..but the real question I think is &quot; how can we use it wisely and to benefit not only us but many more&quot;,1
15374,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"with all this talk about how looks shouldn&#39;t matter, I wonder how attractive her boyfriend/husband will be?",1
15375,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"as a straight male (which you make so obviously clear), maybe this is old news to you, but reiterating this information never hurts. and plus, she provides a specific vantage point by shedding light on the fashion industry in which she participated in. maybe you&#39;ve heard it before, but it&#39;s still empowering to me no matter how many times i hear it. and it&#39;s probably trivial to you because you think women are trivial. so eat my vitamin-enriched tuna ho!",1
15376,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I like this talk although I couldn&#39;t really understand what the main point of it was..,1
15377,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,are you trying to tell me you don&#39;t think everyone knows that society is superficial? or that it favors white people? or maybe you&#39;re trying to tell me you think people don&#39;t know that model photos are photoshopped?,1
15378,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,chubby chaser over here!,1
15379,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I agree. on top of that, she&#39;s insecure about her LOOKS. she just got done saying how little looks should matter, and instead of spending time being insecure about her talent, intelligence, etc, she wastes time worrying about the extra 2 or 3 pounds.",1
15380,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,&quot;everyone knows&quot;? ok thanks for speaking on behalf of all the TED subscribers. your work here is done. everyone go home. you&#39;re dismissed.,1
15381,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Its good to know that models feel as powerless about society&#39;s ideals of beauty as the majority of us who cannot fit that ideal.  I appreciate her sharing her feelings.  I think that models themselves should come together and discuss these issues.  But hey that&#39;s business for you, they create and tell us what we want.",1
15382,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,or maybe it has something to do with the fact that everyone knows what she&#39;s saying already and she&#39;s wasting our time,1
15383,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,or maybe it has something to do with the fact that we know all this shit already and it&#39;s a waste of time to have some girl tell us these things as if we don&#39;t already know them,1
15384,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not really, it seem that your skills at reading minds via one-line YouTube comments need some refinement :)",1
15385,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,i honestly love this so much. idk why everyone is hating on it... maybe because everyone else is a man and doesn&#39;t really give a shit,1
15386,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,what are you talking about? everything she said was obvious and known to EVERYONE already,1
15387,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"You do realize what TED stands for right? Technology, Education, and Design. This talk falls well within those boundaries. ",1
15388,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,agree,1
15389,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"it&#39;s not jealousy. I&#39;m glad someone pretty is at least somewhat self-aware. but all she&#39;s doing is spouting shit we already know, in a way that makes me think she doesn&#39;t think we know it already. it also doesn&#39;t change anything. people will continue to be as superficial as they are, and continue to make youtube comments saying &quot;I&#39;d hit that&quot;.",1

",1
15392,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Very impressive, this woman is very insightful and perceptive. ",1
15393,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,way to miss the point and feed into everything she&#39;s talking about completely,1
15394,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,uh might be just you,1
15395,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,how does it add anything to know that a model acknowledges something we already know? Does it inform us to make any changes? Is it interesting in some way? No. Waste of time.,1
15396,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I would tap that xD,1
15397,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"bound to be an endless line of jealous comments on this talk! very much enjoyed it, i think people underestimate the difficulty for her of not falling into the obvious passage of life where she would never admit to these kinds of things, impressive",1
15398,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Don&#39;t let unsuccessful people make you feel guilty for your success as a model. It&#39;s difficult enough for anyone to be successful at anything. Being too imperfect to be a model doesn&#39;t make you a contender for President (or anything else).
Be glad you have a calling that pays well &amp; gives you the option to use the money &amp; fame to support / advocate causes you believe in. You&#39;ve earned the perks to offset the jealous catclaws! 
Check your stats though if you want to pursue public speaking.",1
15399,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,cut to: fapping on x-art,1
15400,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she didnt say nearly enough....,1
15401,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Ok admit it, how many of us validated what she just said by clicking on this particular TEDS talk because a model was doing the talk. I know it influenced my decision. I don&#39;t watch all the talks, but I was more likely to watch this one because of who she was not just what she was saying.",1
15402,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Am i the only one that finds her more attractive after she &quot;dressed down&quot;?,1
15403,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I guess that opinion would be easy to form if one were to only look at it superficially.,1
15404,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Awesome, honest talk!",1
15405,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Great talk, very cleverly done.",1
15406,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow, she is hot",1
15407,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"yes, you&#39;re cashing out on society&#39;s superficiality. anything else you want to tell me that you think I don&#39;t know already?",1
15408,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I see you also watched the video...,1
15409,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,an apple is an apple is truer,1
15410,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i actually found this genuine, as compared to other speakers in campaigns about &quot;loving your body / regaining self-confidence / accepting yourself for who you are&quot;. i love the message she tries to get across. image, image, image.",1
15411,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Pseudo intellectualism at its best, take a few poignant world issues like racial unequally and blend it all in! Yeah whatever! I&#39;m not a hater, she&#39;s beautiful, so much so she should stick to her day job! The change of clothing was nothing but an attempt to be provocative... Grow up!",1
15412,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,The hottest one in TED talks,1
15413,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I love how, ironically, you took this video at face value, and left after ten seconds, when you decided you knew what it was about.",1
15414,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"great talk, still i went back to 0:19.",1
15415,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;The free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life and that&#39;s what we don&#39;t like to talk about....I got these free things because of how I look, not who I am. And there are people who are paying a cost for how they look and not who they are.&quot;",1
15416,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"omg i would fuck the living shit out of this broad. fuck all your pseudo-intellectual, pretentious bullshit! lets keep it real!!!!!!",1
15417,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Perhaps you&#39;ve forgotten what the E in TED is for...,1
15418,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"It is the social world that causes a preoccupation with image, and Cameron is entirely right. Although herself, and many others, have been beneficiaries of the current model of the social world, which is vastly based on superficialities, it does not guarantee felicity. It may be easier to find a job as a result of image, but we need to break away from these human constructs that so often cause cleavages in society. The quicker we acknowledge the superficiality and act accordingly, the better. ",1
15419,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;These pictures are not pictures of me, they are constructions. And they are constructions by a group of professionals: By hairstylists and make-up artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production their they build this, that&#39;s not me.&quot;  ^_^",1
15420,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Since when is TED onlu about science? Sure, there are great presentations about new innovations and technologies, but there are also great talks about more personal incites and experiences that many people don&#39;t always understand. Way to be closed-minded.",1
15421,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,5:50 great comparison :),1
15422,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"wow, wowwee wow, she&#39;s hot.",1
15423,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,shes so inspiring ,1
15424,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,No one will miss you.,1
15425,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I don&#39;t know a lot of models who give speeches like this, probably a little nervous",1
15426,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"&quot;Saying you want to be a modelwhen you grow up is akin to saying you want to win the powerball(? lottery) when you grow up. It&#39;s out of your controle, and it&#39;s awesome and it&#39;s not a career path.&quot; ^_^ nice",1
15427,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"i remember when i watched SCIENCE videos on TED

this is where i unsubscribe, good riddance",1
15428,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Why is she winded? She sounds like she is out of breath.,1
15429,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Looks aren&#39;t everything, but they&#39;re a big deal.",1
15430,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Good point, prove your self, and take care of your looks. ",1
15431,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"learn to read comments, ignorant",1
15432,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Not the greatest talk but a pretty good talk. She provided a perspective that questioned some of the prejudices I had about models and modeling. I did not expect a standing ovation but worthy of a good round of applause for having the guts to talk about insecurities and other subtle aspects of a supposed glamorous lifestyle. As someone said before, a good perspective for those considering modeling as an option. Good one Cameron. ",1
15433,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"btw, i never said she was racist",1
15434,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Wonderful talk!,1
15435,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,She&#39;s right :),1
15436,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"how was my comment racist? 
she&#39;s the one who mentioned that darker skin women have less chances to get in the modelling career. What i meant with my comment was this all seems like &#39;pretty talk&#39; and i doubt that she would fix this injustice (give her place to the less privileged women) if she had the chance to.",1
15437,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"Boo hoo I&#39;m gorgeous. This talk was all over the place and had no focus. It started badly with her ineffective appearance change; a better approach would have been if she had come out looking like a goofy nerd and then did a gotcha moment. Then it carried on to moaning about a privileged career? 
Cry me a river of crocodile tears. Take the benefits and shut up. No one cares that you feel sad inside for the black men in jail or the lack of ethnic models. 
Less crap like this in future please TED.",1
15438,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,I think the whole point of the talk was not about her lottery but her insecurities in a cut-throat industry,1
15439,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"What? Dude ideas are ideas, somtimes they are better sometimes they not, but they all have in comman, that they have value. 
Just because a idea doesn&#39;t have value for you, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t from value for another person.
Be happy there is such a awsome channel.
",1
15440,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The fact that you instantly jump to such an assumption shows that you are racist, not her.",1
15441,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,Smart woman.,1
15442,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"The transformation was true. As a man, she went from this hot barbie doll I wanted to see to this woman, still beautiful and attractive, that was appropriately dressed for a talk instead of a fashion show. Most of us know that the fashion industry works the way she does and that she&#39;s reaped benefits of being &quot;legacy,&quot; but the power of the talk falls on the fact that very few people in those shoes are willing to admit that publicly. ",1
15443,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,amazing and honest talk,1
15444,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"typical &quot;don&#39;t hate the player, hate the game&quot;. The question is, would she give her place in modeling to a darker skin women if she had the chance, i don&#39;t think so.",1
15445,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,did you not see her PUT ON that skirt?,1
15446,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,"I think she had some good points but failed to join them together, at the end of the talk I wasn&#39;t sure what the whole purpose was. Respect for her to open like that in front of an audience though",1
15447,KM4Xe6Dlp0Y,she was referring to the transition from powerful to superficial. not sure what is stupid about truth and honesty.,1

We don&#39;t realize the irreparable damage we do. These documentaries should be a subject of study in all schools from the first school year. Children must know that their behavior in life does not have to be like that of their parents if they want to have a future. if children talk about what they learned in school and make parents feel guilty for their behavior; they can induce parents to change their lifestyle for their future life. I know it&#39;s bad to say it, but as we continue not to understand that these behaviors of ours are damaging the planet ... maybe children can awaken the consciences of all adults. We always remember that it is we who need the planet to live ... the planet will continue to exist and will take back everything that man has taken from it!

Even if it isn&#39;t money, we are paying a price, and that is our biodiversity, flora and fauna. Air conditioners release CFCs, also known as chlorofluorocarbon, which has created a massive hole in the ozone layer of the atmosphere, allowing more heat and harmful UV rays into the earth. Plastic bags choke animals every single day. Only 5% of the world&#39;s bluefin tuna has survived! The ocean absorbs a whole third of our carbon emissions, and what are we doing? Destroying it. We&#39;re killing its plants and eating its fish so much they&#39;re getting wiped out. The ocean is dying. It can&#39;t support us anymore. 3 or 4 football fields of the Amazon rainforest are cleared every single second. Approximately 30 species of animals go extinct every single year.

16940,GfO-3Oir-qM,"What I suggest that we should create one of them space arks and farm there. Not only u can farm you can also experiment and study in space, build and attach better satellites and other communication systems both for the planet and in space. Imagine the advancement of discovering planets, galaxies and nebulae and our capabilities of contacting the faraway satellites like the voyagers we sent. It will also serve as an emergency evacuation we come to encounter catastrophic disaster like unmanageable asteroid strikes or severe effects of climate change. It can also serve a ship if we want to travel in space. There are so many benefits, possibilities, opportunities and capabilities building a space ark  can do to us. I hope our focus is this in the future, not spending it to useless wars and other non-beneficial things that will only cause harm to both humanity and the environment.",1

16982,GfO-3Oir-qM,"The forces of nature are absolutely unbreakable, even with the Human Being walking on it&#39;s surface. <br>Like George Carlin once said:<br><br>[ The planet has been through a lot worse than us. Been through earthquakes, volcanoes, plate tectonics, continental drift, solar flares, sun spots, magnetic storms, the magnetic reversal of the poles  hundreds of thousands of years of bombardment by comets and asteroids and meteors, worldwide floods, tidal waves, worldwide fires, erosion, cosmic rays, recurring ice ages  And we think some plastic bags and some aluminum cans are going to make a difference? The planet isnt going anywhere. WE are!<br><br>Were going away. Pack your shit, folks. Were going away. And we wont leave much of a trace, either. Maybe a little Styrofoam  The planetll be here and well be long gone. Just another failed mutation. Just another closed-end biological mistake. An evolutionary cul-de-sac. <b>The planet will shake us off like a bad case of fleas</b><br><br>The planet will be here for a long, LONG time after were gone, and it will heal itself, it will cleanse itself, cause thats what it does. Its a self-correcting system. The air and the water will recover, the earth will be renewed. ]<br><br>That&#39;s kind of my life motto to die in peace with myself. Don&#39;t get me wrong, everyday I do my part the best I can, but some things are just out of my hands. Nature don&#39;t need us. It will continue with or without us...

They&#39;re literally selling out the entire planet. We would have had electric cars 30 years ago. We would be completely renewable in our energy grid by now if it weren&#39;t for the fossil fuel companies buying patents and withholding the technology. And what do they get for it? Subsidies. They get a free ride while they destroy the planet. It&#39;s the classic ignorant human mistake. We think we&#39;re improving something because we&#39;re too stupid to understand the intricacies that exist in nature. So we bulldoze our way through only to realize we&#39;ve made our original problem worse and now have 5 other problems on top of it. I actually wonder whether we are the smartest species on the planet. Based on our actions, it would be hard to believe that is true. I also wonder why we&#39;re the oddball on the planet.

I LOVE MY EARTH. And the scientific fact is, it doesn&#39;t make sense why modern-day age racism still prevails today because the question is why do we think we&#39;re called Earthlings or earthians and we all live together on one planet cause we&#39;re the natives of the earth as the human species. There&#39;s no earth for blacks only. There&#39;s no earth for whites and other races of other humans only. Because we all stay together on the same planet together as a human species.

17118,GfO-3Oir-qM,"I have some words of encouragement in the midst of what&#39;s going on. It might sound wierd, but it is for real and I thought that it would be important to say it.<br><br>Its long because I&#39;ve tried to and any faqs! <br>Hopefully this will answer some of those nagging questions - <br>Why can&#39;t evil be forgiven and let off, how is the whole &quot;Jesus dying&quot; thing really relevant to anything? To you? if you still have any questions let me know x<br><br>Do you ever struggle? Or doubt that God Loves You After what you&#39;ve done? Do you wonder if He even exists for that matter? Read this:<br><br>Every one of us have lied, stolen (even tiny things count as stealing), spoken badly to our parents and had embarrassing and detestable thoughts in our thought life. The Bible calls this &quot;sin&quot;, the breaking of God&#39;s laws. You might think, so what? Everyone lies and thinks bad things about others! Its human!<br><br>You&#39;re right. That&#39;s exactly what the Bible says, we&#39;re &quot;born into sin&quot; and that &quot;all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&quot; - Romans <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfO-3Oir-qM&amp;t=3m23s"">3:23</a><br><br>What is that &quot;glory&quot;, morally speaking?<br>Well, the opposite of human nature and desires.<br>Not lying, not stealing, and having a perfect thought life is God&#39;s standard for us. <br><br>But if its God&#39;s standard and we were made in &quot;God&#39;s image&quot;, Why don&#39;t we meet it? <br>Well, Remember Adam and Eve and when they sinned. Before sin they were perfect in thought word and DEED completely, but after the first sin occured due to Satan&#39;s tempting in the Garden, it destroyed that part of us that was morally perfect and in perfect harmony with God&#39;s morals, standard, and love. So while we kept certain things, the ability to be thinking individuals with unique personalities, the moral part (affecting how our thoughts, actions and personalities operate) was damaged. To the point where we are &quot;opposed&quot; to God, hence His nature and standards being the opposite of what we see as reasonable or possible. The Bible even makes it clear that &quot;apart from God you can do nothing&quot; - John 15:5. Without Him, it will 100% feel &quot;opposite&quot;, unreasonable and alien to us. Only WITH Him can we gain victory in these things.<br><br>Why doesn&#39;t God just let sin off and leave it?<br>The Bible describes God as a &quot;righteous judge&quot;, many wonder why God doesn&#39;t just let sin off and leave it, but He can&#39;t. Why? That&#39;s like a if a judge let off a <br>murderer who broke the state law. Everyone would attack that judge and call Him corrupt, saying that he had not done right and should be fired for failing to punish the murderer for his evil. AND to completely love and be good as God is, means you need to, in turn, hate all forms of evil. You can&#39;t truly love good unless you hate the existence of evil.<br><br>This means that God needed, as a righteous judge to punish sin with the ultimate penalty of death - expressing His hatred of evil - and separation from His presence forever. Hence Hell.<br><br>&quot;The soul that sins shall die (in Hell and suffer damnation)&quot; - Ezekiel <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfO-3Oir-qM&amp;t=18m20s"">18:20</a><br><br>But God, who is also love, did not want to see His creation tortured and cut off from Him. He cares so much for is that He couldn&#39;t bear to see us fall into Satans hands and suffer death, even though we broke the law and deserve to bear the guilt, pain and be cut off from perfection forever through damnation.<br><br>Because of justice, God could not leave sin and evil unpunished, BUT because of LOVE, God provided someone else to take that punishment on our behalf, satisfying both justice (by punishing the evil committed), and love (by sparing OUR lives) despite our sin. <br><br>God sent His own SON - think about that. His *Son*, the one whom He loved infinitely (the same way He loves us).<br><br>God allowed Him to take the pain we deserved, He took ALL of Gods wrath for every single sin you and I have committed. He was punished brutally and completely as if He was the picture of mankind&#39;s sin itself so that we do not have to be punished. <br><br>Back in the courtroom scenario: He paid the &quot;fine&quot; at His own expense (His life had to be morally perfect on this Earth, then He had to be killed as a sinless sacrifice on our behalf).<br>So when He returns to remove all evil from the face of the Earth, we can be spared and free because Christ has already BEEN punished on our behalf. He then rose again on the third day, conquering not only life and sin and temptation, but DEATH. <br><br>&quot;I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live (immortally and eternally in Heaven when I return)&quot; - John <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfO-3Oir-qM&amp;t=11m25s"">11:25</a>,26<br><br>ALL we have to do is accept it by faith. Faith alone in Christ alone.<br><br>Religion = rules to be saved<br><br>The gospel = Christ saved us already we just have to believe it by faith. If you lack faith (as I did before), pray. He will make it strong it time. Trust Him as you would trust those close to you. He knows you even better than that. He created you and knows you inside out.<br><br>...WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<br><br>What does it actually mean for us?<br>It means we can be completely free from the penalty of damnation.<br>Not only that but we can be restored to Him and recreated into His moral image AGAIN as long as we accept Jesus having paid the price for us and accept Him as our Lord, the one who is in the front seat of our lives. He has a plan for your life, He&#39;s created you for a purpose. Just remember that. A purpose that includes being recreated into His image, one you can only accomplish through Him and reliance on His power and by following HIS way of life. <br><br>What does this new way of life entail?<br><br>It entails love, true love and service and aid to others, to &quot;love God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength&quot; and &quot;love your neighbour as you love yourself&quot; Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfO-3Oir-qM&amp;t=22m37s"">22:37</a>, 39. <br><br>Sharing the message of Christ&#39;s death, resurrection and soon return on this Earth to give justice OR mercy depending on what the person chose.<br><br>Sound &quot;opposite&quot; again? <br>God knows it sounds opposite, which is why, as The Bible states, this is NOT something we can do alone. It&#39;s not in our nature. <br><br>We need a new nature in the front seat, and the first step is to repent (turn from and reject our sin, pursuing the opposite direction and drawing close to God)<br><br>Christ will give us an actual DESIRE to do these things. Through the Holy Spirit, sent by Him to us after the ascension. He speaks to us through thoughts of love and truth and conviction, verses, ideas, prayers and He guides us so that we gain a desire to follow God and be able to do these &quot;opposite&quot; things through Him.<br><br>&quot;With man it is impossible, but with God, NOTHING is impossible!&quot; - Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfO-3Oir-qM&amp;t=19m26s"">19:26</a> <br><br>What is the way FOR though?<br>Firstly its to save you from sin - the only way to gain victory over sin and not have it as your master is through having Christ as your master and following His aid to resist the devil&#39;s temptations.<br><br>Christ lived down here for 33 years suffering EVERY FORM of temptation that you have ever faced - &quot;who in every respect [has] been tempted as we are, yet without sin&quot; Hebrews <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfO-3Oir-qM&amp;t=4m15s"">4:15</a>.<br><br>Therefore He is able to help us through our struggles. When the devil knows people have left his camp, he always tries harder with more temptations and evil attacks. BUT - His way is also there to guard and teach you daily in the midst of this (and despite this) sinful, selfish world.<br><br>The path He wants you to walk is a path of committment and love - its not about rules and regulations to save us - what Christ did GAVE us salvation. <br>All we need is faith. <br>The rest, the &quot;fruits of good works (the will to obey and follow Him)&quot;, are what come through true, maturing faith. It&#39;s all about faith and the relationship God wants with you just like before sin arrived. <br><br>God preferred His own Son to be tortured And <b>killed</b> to give a chance to us (who broke His law of perfection) so that we can live as His children again. He wants us to love and trust and worship Him.<br><br>What if I still find myself sinning after I have accepted Christ?<br><br>That&#39;s why Christ died, For our sin. His death doesn&#39;t fix us in a snap like that, but it does protect us from the damnation that our past, present and future sins would bring without Jesus.<br><br>It&#39;s a process - a lifelong process - of God bringing you back to Him, away from the destructive pleasures of sin (greed, selfish temptations, trampling on people to gain). This process takes a *lifetime*, as it does for all, but NEVER give up, when you fall, know Christ paid for that sin you committed already - just acknowledge your sin and ask for forgiveness - and you can get back up again because He already bore your guilt and shame.<br><br>Regardless of the darkness you are in or the extent or frequency of the sins you have committed or will commit, regardless of how doubtful you may feel, know that Jesus UNDERSTANDS completely and He is faithful. <br><br>&quot;those who come to Me, I will by no means cast out&quot; - John <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfO-3Oir-qM&amp;t=6m37s"">6:37</a><br><br>...HOW DO I LEARN MORE?<br><br>Don&#39;t know where to start?<br>Note down the Gospel of &quot;John&quot;, or &quot;Luke&quot; (if you want a more detailed account of it all).<br><br>Remember that He will &quot;NEVER - and that means never - leave you, NOR forsake you&quot; - Deuteronomy 31:6 <br><br>Regardless of what goes on down here, God knows, Jesus has been down here and felt all the emotions you are feeling. You can go to Him with them and be assured that He loves you and is for you. <br><br>Rememeber, even in the storm, God is still there, walking on the water alongside you!<br><br>Keep your heart open to Him and remember that if we pray for Christ to enter our lives, He will. <br><br>&quot;For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only begotten Son, that whomever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life&quot;. - John <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfO-3Oir-qM&amp;t=3m16s"">3:16</a><br>Thanks for reading if you did. I just felt that I should tell you regardless.<br><br>Let me know if you have any more questions or if you need any clarification on anything. xxx",1

A lot of this &quot;chicken little, the sky is falling&quot;, liberal rhetoric and propaganda is going a little too far though. Humans have not been decimating the world as much as some would overstate and over characterize the situation. It is a sign of hubris to think that we are destroying the world through our evolving. For example, the human civilization has only produced about 1/10,000 of one percent of the total CO2 expelled by volcanoes every year. There is plenty of room for human expansion, so overpopulation is pure propaganda also. Do you realize how big the earth is and how little of it that we inhabit? We have the amazing propensity to create the amount of things we need to survive with our technology and problem-solving ability. We are getting a lot better at taking care of our world and the impact we have on it. As we progress away from fossil fuels, or develop ways to clean up behind ourselves even better, we can live in equilibrium with nature.",1

17935,GfO-3Oir-qM,"The documentary put forward by Netflix is one of the most viewed and recommended by the viewers themselves. A round of appreciation to all those director of photography, the editors, and the natural actors themselves(yes, I am talking about the wildlife who took the role of the protagonist) to educate mankind about their way of living in the wild. These documentary series is not just educational but also has the touch of slow-mo Hollywood thrillers and action films. Its breathtaking to view all these incredible shots that takes place in the distant wildlife. The dance routine of the Manakins, the shoal of Mackerels chased by the predators of the ocean, the impending danger, caused due to human activity, to the snow Walruses that makes them hard to live elevating their death rate and so on.The habitats that have been classified as natural reserve has seen a drastic bloom in the wildlife trying to restore nature to its original form.Even the abandoned Chernobyl has seen a rise in its wildlife  count since the  disaster in 1986 which had forced the people out from the city.Thus revealing that Nature itself is capable enough to heal itself and restore back to what it had been a long time ago. <br>-Bipasha Roy",1
